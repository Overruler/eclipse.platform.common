<h3>Customizing a product</h3>
<p>There are many customizable aspects of a product, such as its splash screen,
  about dialog text,  window icons, etc. Most of these customizations are defined
  in the contribution to the <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_runtime_products.html"><b>org.eclipse.core.runtime.products</b></a>
extension point.</p>
<p>
Let's look at how some of the more common customizable elements are defined.</p>
<h3>About dialogs</h3>
<p>The platform &quot;about&quot; dialog is shown whenever the user selects <b>Help-&gt;About
</b>in the workbench menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/about.gif" alt="About dialog" border="0" ></p>
<p>The upper part of the about dialog shows product level information while the
  lower part details the features (if any) and plugins installed.&nbsp; The feature
  details (branding if you will) are supplied using<b> about.ini</b>, <b>about.properties</b> and <b>about.html</b>
files in the plug-in associated with the feature.&nbsp; This
information is displayed when the user requests feature details and selects a
particular feature.</p>
<p>The product branding (top half of the dialog) is specify by properties that
  describe
the text and images that are shown in this dialog.
<pre><font color="#4444CC">	&lt;property
		name="aboutText"
		value="%aboutText"/&gt;
	&lt;property
		name="aboutImage"
		value="icons/eclipse_lg.gif"/&gt;
	&lt;/product&gt;</font></pre>
<ul>
  <li><b>aboutText</b> specifies the text to show in the about dialog</li>
  <li><b>aboutImage</b> specifies an image that should be used in the about dialog.  Large
  images will be shown by themselves, and smaller images will be shown along with the about
  text.</li>
</ul>
See <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/branding/IProductConstants.html">IProductConstants</a></b>
for more information about these properties.
</p>
<h3>Window images</h3>
<p>A 16x16 pixel color image can be used to brand windows created by the
product.&nbsp; It will appear in the upper left hand corner of product
windows.&nbsp; It is specified in the <b>windowImage</b> attribute in the 
products extension definition.  Alternatively, the <b>windowImages</b> attribute
can be used to describe an array of images of different sizes that should be used in the
upper left hand corner. 
<pre><font color="#4444CC">&lt;property
		name="windowImages"
		value="icons/eclipse.gif,icons/eclipse32.gif"/&gt;</font></pre>
The <b>windowImages</b> property supercedes the <b>windowImage</b> property if
both are specified.
<h3>Welcome page</h3>
<p>Products using the Eclipse 2.1 welcome page mechanism can specify the name and location
of their welcome page file in the <b>welcomePage</b> property.  
<pre><font color="#4444CC">	&lt;property
		name="welcomePage"
		value="$nl$/welcome.xml"/&gt;</font></pre>
Use of this property is 
discouraged in Eclipse 3.0 in favor of the <b><a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_intro.html">org.eclipse.ui.intro</a></b>
extension point.  See <a href="workbench_advext_intro.htm">Intro support</a> for more
detail about the new welcome/intro mechanisms.
<h3><a name="preferences"></a>Preferences defaults</h3>

<p>The <b>preferenceCustomization</b> property can be used to specify a file containing
default preference values for the product.
<pre><font color="#4444CC">	&lt;property
		name="preferenceCustomization"
		value="plugin_customization.ini"/&gt;</font></pre>
<p>This file is a <b>java.io.Properties</b> format file.
  Typically this file is used to set the values for preferences that are published
  as part of a plug-in's public API.&nbsp; That is, you are taking a risk if you
  refer to preferences that are used by plug-ins but not defined formally in the
  API.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Splash screens</h3>
<p>The product splash screen is specified in the <tt>config.ini</tt> which is
  located underneath the product's <tt>configuration</tt> directory. The <b>osgi.splashPath</b> property
  in this file describes places to search for a file called <b>splash.bmp</b>.
  The <strong>osgi.splashLocation </strong>property identifes a complete and
  exact path to the splash screen file to use. Specifying a splash path allows
  for locale specific splash screens to be used as the given search path can
  indicate several plug-ins or fragments to search as well as <code>$nl$</code> style paths.
  See the
  platform
  SDK's <tt>config.ini</tt> file
  for a complete description of properties that can be configured in this file.
  The image should be supplied in 24-bit color BMP format (RGB format) and should
  be approximately 500x330 pixels in size.</p>
