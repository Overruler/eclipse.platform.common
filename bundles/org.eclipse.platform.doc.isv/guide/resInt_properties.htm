Resource properties</H2>
<P >
Resources can have properties that hold state information defined by your tool.  Resource properties are declared, accessed, and maintained by various plug-ins, and are not interpreted by the platform.  When a resource is deleted from the workspace, its properties are also deleted.</P>
<P >
There are two kinds of resource properties:</P>
<ul>
  <li>
    
<b>
Session properties</b> allow your plug-ins to cache information in key-value pairs.
The values are arbitrary objects.&nbsp; These properties are maintained in memory and lost when a resource is deleted from the workspace, or
when the project or workspace is closed.</li>
  <li>
    
<b>
Persistent properties</b> are used to store resource-specific information on disk.  The value of a persistent property is an arbitrary string. Your plug-in decides how to interpret the string.  The strings are intended to be short (under 2KB).  Persistent properties are stored on disk
with the platform metadata and maintained across platform shutdown and restart.</li>
</ul>
<i><blockquote>
Note:&nbsp; If you have large persistent properties, you should expose these as resources in their own right rather than using the persistent properties API.</blockquote></i>
<i><blockquote>
Note:&nbsp; If you follow the convention of qualifying property key names with
the unique id of your plug-in, you won't have to worry about your property names colliding with those of other plug-ins.</blockquote></i>
<P >
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IResource.html">
IResource</a></b> provides protocol (<b>getSessionProperty</b>,
<b>setSessionProperty</b>, <b>getPersistentProperty</b>,
<b>setPersistentProperty</b>) for using properties.</P>
