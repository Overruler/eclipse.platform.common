<h2>Customizing a product</h2>
<p>The plug-in associated with a <a href="product_def_primary.htm">primary
feature</a> is where the branding information for a product is specified.&nbsp;
There are many customizable aspects of a product.&nbsp; Product-level
customizations are defined using the <b>about.ini</b> file and other files
described therein.&nbsp; Products can also control the default preference values
of other plug-ins.&nbsp; This is done using the <b>plugin_customization.ini</b>
file.</p>
<p>Referring once again to our sample product's primary feature plug-in, let's
look closer at how the product is customized.</p>
<pre><font color="#4444CC"><b>com.example.acme.acmefeature_1.0.0/</b></font><font color="#4444CC">
		plugin.xml
		<b>about.ini
		about.html
		about.mappings
		about.properties
		acme.gif
		plugin_customization.ini
		plugin_customization.properties
		splash.bmp
		welcome.xml</b></font></pre>
<h3>About dialogs</h3>
<p>The platform &quot;about&quot; dialog is shown whenever the user selects <b>Help-&gt;About
</b>in the workbench menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" border="0" src="images/about.jpg" width="486" height="321"></p>
<p>The about dialog is constructed using information supplied by features and
plug-ins.&nbsp; All features and plug-ins should contribute an <b>about.html</b>
file that provides information about that particular plug-in.&nbsp; This
information is displayed when the user requests feature details or plug-in
details and selects a particular feature or plug-in.</p>
<p>The primary feature also supplies the information and graphics for the
overall product.&nbsp; Additional files are used to specify this information.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>about.ini</b> specifies the about text and images for features,
    windows, and the about dialog itself.&nbsp; It also specifies the welcome
    page.&nbsp; See <a href="../reference/misc/about_customization.html">Customization
    using about.ini </a>for a complete description of the format of this file.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>about.properties</b> should be used to hold translated strings from the
    <b>about.ini </b>file (using &quot;%var&quot; as the value in about.ini paired with an
    entry for the key &quot;var&quot; in about.properties.&nbsp; This file is a <b>java.io.Properties</b>
    format file.</li>
  <li><b>about.mappings</b> can be used to fill in values for fill-in fields in
    the about text.&nbsp; This is useful when the about text contains
    information specific to a particular install, such as license key, install
    date, or licensed user. For example, the about text could be defined as
    &quot;AcmeWeb is licensed to {0}&quot;.&nbsp; The about.mappings file could
    be generated at install time based on input from the user.&nbsp; The final
    form should contain a mapping for the field, such as &quot;0=Joe Q. Webuser&quot;.&nbsp;
    The about.mappings file is a <b>java.io.Properties</b> format file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Window images</h3>
<p>A 16x16 pixel color image can be used to brand windows created by the
product.&nbsp; It will appear in the upper left hand corner of product
windows.&nbsp; It is specified in the <b>windowImage</b> attribute in the <b>about.ini</b>
file.&nbsp; The path should be specified as a plug-in relative path.&nbsp; A
proper entry for the directory structure shown above would be as follows:</p>
<pre><font color="#4444CC">windowImage=acme.gif</font></pre>
<h3>Welcome page</h3>
<p>The description for the product's welcome page should be defined in an xml
file in the format described in <a href="../reference/misc/welcome.html">Platform
Welcome Page Configuration</a>.&nbsp; It is specified in the welcomePage
attribute in the about.ini file. The path should be specified as a plug-in
relative path.&nbsp; A proper entry for the directory structure shown above
would be as follows:</p>
<pre><font color="#4444CC">welcomePage=welcome.xml</font></pre>
<p>You can also specify an national language lookup for the file.&nbsp; (See <a href="product_def_nl.htm">Locale
specific files</a> for more detail.)</p>
<pre><font color="#4444CC">welcomePage=$nl$/welcome.xml</font></pre>
<h3>Splash screens</h3>
<p>The product splash screen is supplied in a <b>splash.bmp</b> file located in
the primary feature plug-in directory.&nbsp; The image should be supplied in
24-bit color BMP format (RGB format) and should be approximately 500x330 pixels in
size.&nbsp; If splash screens need to be customized for different locales, they
can be placed in a fragment of the primary feature's plug-in.</p>
<h3>Preferences defaults</h3>
<p>The <b>plugin_customization.ini</b>
 file is used to set the default preference values for preferences defined by
other plug-ins.&nbsp; This file is a <b>java.io.Properties</b> format file.
Typically this file is used to set the values for preferences that are published
as part of a plug-in's public API.&nbsp; That is, you are taking a risk if you
refer to preferences that are used by plug-ins but not defined formally in the
API.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One common customization is to set the default perspective for the
workbench.&nbsp; This preference is defined in the <b>org.eclipse.ui </b>plug-in.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
following example assumes that the product should be launched with the resource
perspective as the default perspective.</p>
<pre><font color="#4444CC">org.eclipse.ui/defaultPerspectiveId=org.eclipse.ui.resourcePerspective</font></pre>
<p>If you discover you need to change the default value for one of another plug-in's
preferences, consult the API documentation for that plug-in to see if the
preference is considered public.</p>
<p>The <b>plugin_customization.properties</b> file contains translated strings
for the <b>plugin_customization.ini</b>
 file.<font color="#4444CC"><br>
