Compare support</H1>


The Compare plugin (named <b>org.eclipse.compare</b>) implements:

<p>

<ul>
	<li>
	Two and Three-way compare/merge components for hierarchical structures superimposed on text
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Differencing engines for:
	<ul>
		<li>
		hierarchical structures 
		</li>
		<li>
		character ranges, e.g. text lines or words 
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Integration of patch files 
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Comparison and merging with the local history. 
	</li>
</ul>

In order to be extensible to different content types the infrastructure
defines the following extension points:
<p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_compare_contentMergeViewers.html"><b>org.eclipse.compare.contentMergeViewers</b></a>
	<br>
	A content merge viewer performs a two-way or three-way compare of its inputs, presents the result
	side-by-side or in any other suitable way, and lets the user merge between the inputs. 
	Typical examples for content merge viewers are compare viewers for text or images.
	</li>

	<li>
	<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_compare_structureMergeViewers.html"><b>org.eclipse.compare.structureMergeViewers</b></a>
	<br>
	A structure merge viewer performs a two-way or three-way compare of its inputs, typically presents the result
	in a hierarchical way, and lets the user merge between the inputs. 
	Typical examples for structure merge viewers are viewers showing workspace resources or the members of
	an archive file.
	<p>
	</li>
</ul>

Because the implementation of most structure compare viewers is based on a tree and therefore
very similar, the compare plugin provides a generic tree-based
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/structuremergeviewer/StructureDiffViewer.html"><b>StructureDiffViewer</b></a>
that defines its own extension point
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_compare_structureCreators.html"><b>org.eclipse.compare.structureCreators</b></a>.
<p>

A structureCreator breaks a single input object into a hierarchical structure.
The <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/structuremergeviewer/StructureDiffViewer.html"><b>StructureDiffViewer</b></a>
performs the compare on the resulting structure and displays the result as a tree.
<p>

In addition there is an extension point <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_compare_contentViewers.html">
<b>org.eclipse.compare.contentViewers</b></a>
for content viewers that do not compare their inputs.
A <b>contentViewer</b> is used in places where only a single input is available and therefore
no compare is necessary. A typical example for this is the "Restore from Local History" function. 
<p>

All compare viewers are standard JFace viewers that expect an input object implementing the
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/structuremergeviewer/ICompareInput.html">ICompareInput</b></a>
interface.
<p>
For implementing viewers the compare plugin provides additional support for:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="compare_contentviewer.htm">content oriented compare and merge viewers</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="compare_contentviewer.htm">structure oriented compare and merge viewers</a>.
</li>
</ul>
