<h2>Markers in the Eclipse IDE </h2>
<p>Markers created using the <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_resources_markers.html">org.eclipse.core.resources.markers</a> support can be shown in 
  the user interface using the <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_ide_markerHelp.html">org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerHelp</a>, 
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_ide_markerResolution.html">org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerResolution</a> 
  and <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_ide_markerSupport.html">org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerSupport</a> extension points. 
  The  org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerImageProvider API is internal of release 3.2.</p>
<p><strong>org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerHelp</strong></p>
<p><code>org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerHelp</code> is the extension point that allows 
  you to associate a help context with your marker type.</p>
<p><strong>org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerResolution</strong></p>
<p><code>org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerResolution</code> is the extension point that 
  allows you to contribute Quick Fixes for markers. The Java Editor and the Problems 
  View are two places where these can be applied currently. This extension point 
  allows the plug-in developer to specify the <code>IMarkerResolutionGenerator</code> 
  that can determine the possible resolutions to a marker.</p>
<p>As of release 3.2 the Problems View supports multiple resolutions allowing 
  the user to add other matching problems to the list of problems to fix and applying 
  the selected fix to all of them at once. If <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/IMarkerResolution.html">IMarkerResolutions</a> 
  are instances of <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/WorkbenchMarkerResolution.html">WorkbenchMarkerResolution</a> 
  it is possible for users to add other matching <code>WorkbenchMarkerResolutions</code> 
  in the Quick Fix dialog.</p>

<p><strong>org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerSupport </strong></p>
<p><code>org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerSupport</code> is the extension for specifying 
  how markers are displayed in the Problems View. This extension point handles 
  filters and grouping.</p>
<p><strong>Filters</strong></p>
<p>As of Eclipse 3.2 the Problems View handles multiple filters. Note that these 
  filters sum their results rather than find their union. New filters can be added 
  using the problemFilter extension element or manually by the user. Below is 
  the filters section of the Problems View showing user filters and filters added 
  via the extension point (system filters).</p>

<p><strong>Grouped</strong></p>
<p>Markers can be grouped into two ways. The first way is to group marker types 
  into groups using the <code>markerTypeCategory</code> extension. This is shown 
  when the user selects Group By - &gt; Type. Below is an example showing Java 
  Problems and some using a test grouping.</p>
<p><img src="images/problems_view_groupByType.png" alt="Picture of grouping the problems view by type"></p>
<p>When marker types are grouped together they will be shown in those groups in 
  the filters dialog.</p>
<p><img src="images/problems_view_markerTypeCat.png" alt="Picture of grouping the problems view by category"></p>
<p>It is also possible to create your own grouping using the <code>markerGrouping</code> 
  extension which will show up as an extra entry in the Group By-&gt;Menu of the 
  Problems view. The IDE provides a grouping based on severity (the default). 
  JDT provides a Java Type grouping as well in the SDK.</p>
<p><code>markerGroupings</code> are resolved by checking attributes on the <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IMarker.html">IMarker</a>. 
  <code>markerAttributeMappings</code> are used to specify these mappings. Below 
  is the Group By menu with the extra <code>markerGroupings</code> that have been 
  added. The Problems view is currently grouped by severity.</p>
