<h1>Eclipse 3.0 Porting Guide</h1>
<p>Draft for 3.0 M5<br>
Last revised November 20, 2003</p>
<p><i>Note: This is a work in progress. An up-to-date draft of the Eclipse 3.0
Porting Guide is being included with each milestone build to facilitate climbing
aboard the 3.0 release wagon at an early stage, or to estimate the amount of
effort that will be involved in eventually porting existing plug-ins to 3.0. The
Eclipse APIs will be stable with respect to breaking changes by late 2003 (see <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_0.html">Eclipse
3.0 plan</a> for exact dates).</i></p>
<p>This porting guide describes how to port existing 2.1 plug-ins to 3.0. It is
organized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Required Changes for 3.0">Required Changes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Recommended Changes for 3.0">Recommended Changes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Proposed Changes for 3.0">Proposed Changes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#PDE Plug-in Migration Tool">PDE Plug-in Migration Tool</a></li>
  <li><a href="#General Information on Compatibility">General Information on
    Compatibility</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Required Changes for 3.0">Required Changes for 3.0</a></h2>
<p>This section describes changes that impact existing plug-ins. If your plug-in
is affected, you will have to change your plug-in in order to get it to work
properly with Eclipse 3.0.</p>
<h3>Plug-in manifest version</h3>
<p>The header of the manifest files for plug-ins (and plug-in fragments) has
changed to include a new line which identifies the appropriate plug-in manifest
version. Prior to 3.0, plug-ins did not carry one of these &lt;?eclipse ...?&gt;
lines; after 3.0, they must always have one. This change is to allow the Eclipse
runtime to reliably recognize pre-3.0 plug-ins that have not been ported to 3.0,
so that it can automatically provide greater binary compatibility for such
plug-ins. This is the general form of the plugin.xml file (fragment.xml is
similar):</p>
<p><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>
<u>&lt;?eclipse version=&quot;3.0&quot;?&gt;<br>
</u>&lt;plugin ...&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
&lt;/plugin&gt;</code>
<p>When porting to 3.0, add the indicated line to the manifest of existing
plug-ins and plug-in fragments. (The PDE plug-in migration tool adds this line.)</p>
<h3>Restructuring of org.eclipse.ui plug-in</h3>
<p>The org.eclipse.ui plug-in, which used to be the main Platform UI plug-in,
now provides just the API and extension points for the generic (i.e.,
non-IDE-specific) workbench. Optional and IDE-specific API and extension points
have moved to other plug-ins.</p>
<p>The impact of this change is two-fold: (1) the moved org.eclipse.ui extension
points have new extension point ids; and (2) the list of required plug-ins has
changed.</p>
<p>N.B. The Eclipse 3.0 runtime automatically detects pre-3.0 plug-ins (by the
absence of the aforementioned &lt;?eclipse...?&gt; line in the plug-in manifest)
and automatically compensates for these extension point and plug-in dependency
changes. This should be viewed as a stopgap measure that increases the
likelihood that an existing plug-in that depends on org.eclipse.ui will work in
3.0. However, when porting the existing plug-in to 3.0, the plug-in's manifest
needs to be updated to reflect the new structure of the Eclipse UI plug-ins.</p>
<p>The org.eclipse.ui extension points in the following table have moved to
different plug-ins, causing their extension point ids to change. If an existing
plug-in contributes an extension to the moved extension points, then the
reference in the &quot;point&quot; attribute of the &lt;extension&gt; element in
the plug-in manifest file must be changed to refer to the corresponding new ones
extension point id. (The PDE plug-in migration tool makes these fix-ups.)</p>

</table>
<p>The following table lists the API packages formerly provided by the
org.eclipse.ui plug-in that have been moved to different plug-ins. (The names of
the API packages, classes, fields, and methods did not change.) In some cases,
the API packages are now split across more than one plug-in. Since the API
classes visible to any given plug-in are determined by that plug-in's list of
required plug-ins, these changes may require adjusting
&quot;&lt;requires&gt;&quot; elements in an existing plug-in's manifest to
regain access to API class.</p>
<p>This change only affects plug-ins that depend on the org.eclipse.ui plug-in
(that is, includes &lt;import plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.ui&quot;/&gt; in the
&lt;requires&gt; section of the plug-in manifest); all other plug-ins are
unaffected. If it is affected, you <i>may</i> need to change the &lt;import&gt;
element, or add additional &lt;import&gt; elements, so that all the API classes
your plug-in needs are in scope. We strongly recommend that plug-ins only state
dependencies on the plug-ins that they actually use. Including unnecessary
dependencies reduces runtime performance because the Java class loader must
search for classes in all dependents. (The PDE plug-in migration tool will fix
up the dependencies, and help to determine a minimal set.)</p>

<h3>Changes to API classes and interfaces (by package)</h3>
<h4>IWorkbench (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following method was removed from this interface because it was
    IDE-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>public IMarkerHelpRegistry getMarkerHelpRegistry()</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients of getMarkerHelpRegistry() should instead call the public static
    method IDE.getMarkerHelpRegistry() declared in the org.eclipse.ui.ide
    package (org.eclipse.ui.ide plug-in).</li>
</ul>
<h4>IWorkbenchPage (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following methods were removed from this interface because they were
    IDE-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>public IEditorPart openEditor(IFile input)</li>
      <li>public IEditorPart openEditor(IFile input, String editorID)</li>
      <li>public IEditorPart openEditor(IFile input, String editorID, boolean
        activate)</li>
      <li>public IEditorPart openEditor(IMarker marker)</li>
      <li>public IEditorPart openEditor(IMarker marker, boolean activate)</li>
      <li>public void openSystemEditor(IFile input)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients of openEditor(IFile,*) methods should convert the IFile to an
    IEditorInput using new FileEditorInput(IFile) and then call one of the
    openEditor(IEditorInput,*) methods. Thus
    <ul>
      <li>rewrite page.openEditor(file,editorID) as openEditor(new
        FileEditorInput(file), editorID)</li>
      <li>rewrite page.openEditor(file,editorID, activate) as openEditor(new
        FileEditorInput(file), editorID, activate)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients of openEditor(IFile) method should call
    org.eclipse.ui.ide.IDE.openEditor(IWorkbenchPage, IFile, boolean)
    <ul>
      <li>rewrite openEditor(file) as IDE.openEditor(page, file, true)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients of openEditor(IMarker, ...) methods should call
    org.eclipse.ui.ide.IDE.openEditor(IWorkbenchPage, IMarker, boolean)
    <ul>
      <li>rewrite page.openEditor(marker) as IDE.openEditor(page, marker, true)</li>
      <li>rewrite page.openEditor(IMarker, activate) as IDE.openEditor(page,
        marker, activate)</li>
      <li>editors that can position themselves based on IMarker information
        should implement or adapt to org.eclipse.ui.ide.IMarkerEditorPositioner</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients of openSystemEditor(IFile) method should convert the IFile to an
    IEditorInput using new FileEditorInput(IFile) and then call the
    openEditor(IEditorInput,String) method. Thus
    <ul>
      <li>rewrite page.openSystemEditor(file) as page.openEditor(new
        FileEditorInput(file), IEditorRegistry.SYSTEM_EXTERNAL_EDITOR_ID)</li>
      <li>Note: clients using editor id
        IEditorRegistry.SYSTEM_EXTERNAL_EDITOR_ID must pass an editor input
        which implements org.eclipse.ui.IPathEditorInput (which FileEditorInput
        does).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>IEditorPart (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following method was removed from this interface because it was
    resource-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>public void gotoMarker(IMarker marker)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients that called this method should instead test if the editor part
    implements or adapts to org.eclipse.ui.ide.IGotoMarker and if so, call
    gotoMarker(IMarker). The IDE class has a convenience method for doing so:<br>
    <code>IDE.gotoMarker(editor, marker);</code></li>
  <li>Clients that implement an editor that can position itself based on IMarker
    information should implement or adapt to org.eclipse.ui.ide.IGotoMarker.</li>
  <li>Since IGotoMarker's only method is gotoMarker(IMarker), existing editor
    implementations can adapt to this change simply by adding <code>extends
    IGotoMarker</code> to the class definition.</li>
</ul>
<h4>EditorPart (package org.eclipse.ui.part)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following former IEditorPart method was removed from this class
    because it was resource-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>public void gotoMarker(IMarker marker)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>See above instructions for IEditorPart.gotoMarker.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MultiEditor (package org.eclipse.ui.part)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following former IEditorPart method was removed from this class
    because it was resource-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>public void gotoMarker(IMarker marker)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>See above instructions for IEditorPart.gotoMarker.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MultiPageEditor (package org.eclipse.ui.part)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>N.B. This class was previously deprecated</li>
  <li>The following former IEditorPart method was removed from this class
    because it was resource-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>public void gotoMarker(IMarker marker)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>See above instructions for IEditorPart.gotoMarker.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MultiPageEditorPart (package org.eclipse.ui.part)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following former IEditorPart method was removed from this class
    because it was resource-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>public void gotoMarker(IMarker marker)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>See above instructions for IEditorPart.gotoMarker.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IEditorLauncher (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The editor launcher interface is implemented by plug-ins that contribute
    external editors.</li>
  <li>The following method was removed from this interface because it was
    resource-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>public void open(IFile file)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It was replaced by
    <ul>
      <li>public void open(IPath file)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients that call IEditorLauncher.open(file) should instead call
    IEditorLauncher.open(file.getLocation()).</li>
  <li>Clients that implement this interface should replace their implementation
    of open(IFile) by one for open(IPath).</li>
</ul>
<h4>IEditorRegistry (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following methods were removed from this interface because they were
    resource-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>public IEditorDescriptor getDefaultEditor(IFile file)</li>
      <li>public void setDefaultEditor(IFile file, String editorId)</li>
      <li>public ImageDescriptor getImageDescriptor(IFile file)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients that call getImageDescriptor(file) should call the
    &quot;String&quot; equivalent method. Thus rewrite getImageDescriptor(file)
    to be getImageDescriptor(file.getName())</li>
  <li>Clients that call setDefaultEditor(IFile file, String editorId) and
    getDefaultEditor(IFile file) should call the IDE equivalent methods. Thus
    <ul>
      <li>rewrite getDefaultEditor(file) to be IDE.getDefaultEditor(file)</li>
      <li>rewrite setDefaultEditor(file, id) to be IDE.setDefaultEditor(file,
        id)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The API contract for the following method was changed:
    <ul>
      <li>public IEditorDescriptor getDefaultEditor() is now deprecated. It will
        always return the System External Editor editor descriptor</li>
      <li>This change impacts clients that assumed the default editor returned
        would be a text editor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New constants that represent the system external editor and system
    in-place editor identifiers (SYSTEM_EXTERNAL_EDITOR_ID and
    SYSTEM_INPLACE_EDITOR_ID). These two editors require an editor input that
    implements or adapts to org.eclipse.ui.IPathEditorInput. Note, the in-place
    editor descriptor will not exist on platforms that do not support in-place
    editing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>AbstractDocumentProvider (package org.eclipse.ui.texteditor)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In order to free AbstractTextEditor from dependencies on
    org.eclipse.core.resources, AbstractDocumentProvider introduces the concept
    of document provider operations (DocumentProviderOperation) and document
    provider operation runner (IRunnableContext). When requested to perform
    reset, save, or synchronize, the AbstractDocumentProvider creates document
    provider operations and uses the operation runner to execute them. The
    runnable context can be provided by subclasses in the getOperationRunner
    method.</li>
  <li>Added protected abstract IRunnableContext getOperationRunner();
    non-abstract subclasses must implement this method in order to provide their
    own operation runner.</li>
  <li>The method resetDocument has been changed to final in order to allow the
    document provider to wrap the function with a document provider operation.
    The document provider operation calls the newly introduced doResetDocument
    method. AbstractDocumentProvider.doResetDocument contains the code that
    originally resided inside AbstractDocumentProvider.resetDocument. Subclasses
    must change their implementation of resetDocument to doResetDocument and any
    contained call of super.resetDocument to super.doResetDocument.</li>
  <li>The method saveDocument has been changed to final in order to allow the
    document provider to wrap the function with a document provider operation.
    The document provider operation calls the newly introduced doSaveDocument
    method. AbstractDocumentProvider.doSaveDocument contains the code that
    originally resided inside AbstractDocumentProvider.saveDocument. Subclasses
    must change their implementation of saveDocument to doSaveDocument and any
    contained call of super.saveDocument to super.doSaveDocument.</li>
  <li>The method synchronize has been changed to final in order to allow the
    document provider to wrap the function with a document provider operation.
    The document provider operation calls the newly introduced doSynchronize
    method. AbstractDocumentProvider.doSynchronize contains the code that
    originally resided inside AbstractDocumentProvider.synchronize. Subclasses
    must change their implementation of synchronize to doSynchronize and any
    contained call of super.synchronized to super.doSynchronize.</li>
</ul>
<h4>AbstractTextEditor (package org.eclipse.ui.texteditor)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The method IEditorPart.gotoMarker(IMarker marker) was removed from the
    IEditorPart interface because it was resource-specific. The default
    implementation provided by AbstractTextEditor has been removed from
    AbstractTextEditor and has been moved to ExtendedTextEditor. Direct
    subclasses of AbstractTextEditor or StatusTextEditor that want to provide
    that functionality should follow the migration instructions given for
    IEditorPart in this document.</li>
  <li>AbstractTextEditor no longer differentiates between between implicit and
    explicit document providers as the concrete implementation was resource
    specific. This functionality has been moved to ExtendedTextEditor. Direct
    subclasses of AbstractTextEditor or StatusTextEditor must perform the
    following steps:
    <ul>
      <li>Override getDocumentProvider.</li>
      <li>Override the newly introduced hook method for disposing the document
        provider (disposeDocumentProvider)</li>
      <li>Override the newly introduced hook method
        setDocumentProvider(IEditorInput) that is called while updating the
        document provider for the new editor input. I.e. that is the method in
        which you can configure the appropriate implicit document provider for
        the given editor input.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All occurrences of WorkbenchModifyingOperation have been removed. The
    editor now calls the document provider methods directly (see described
    changes for AbstractDocumentProvider);
    <ul>
      <li>Removed createSaveOperation, changed performSaveOperation to
        performSave. Subclasses of AbstractTextEditor overriding
        createSaveOperation or performSaveOperation must now override
        performSave.</li>
      <li>Removed createdRevertOperation, changed peformRevertOperation to
        performRevert. Sunclasses overriding createRevertOperation or
        performRevertOperation must now override performRevert.</li>
      <li>The implementation of the method handleEditorInputChanged has been
        changed to not use WorkbenchModifyingOperation. Subclasses overriding
        handleEditorInputChange must adapt accordingly. Please use the changes
        applied to AbstractTextEditor.handleEditorInputChange as the blueprint.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>AbstractTextEditor.createActions no longer registers any actions under
    ITextEditorActionConstants.ADD_TASK and ITextEditorActionConstant.BOOKMARK
    as those actions are IDE specific. The registration of these actions has
    been moved to ExtendedTextEditor. Direct subclasses of AbstractTextEditor or
    StatusTextEditor should override the createActions method and add the
    following lines (accordingly adapted to their circumstances):</li>
  <li>
    <pre> ResourceAction action= new AddMarkerAction(TextEditorMessages.getResourceBundle(), &quot;Editor.AddBookmark.&quot;, this, IMarker.BOOKMARK, true); //$NON-NLS-1$
  action.setHelpContextId(ITextEditorHelpContextIds.BOOKMARK_ACTION);
  action.setActionDefinitionId(ITextEditorActionDefinitionIds.ADD_BOOKMARK);
  setAction(IDEActionFactory.BOOKMARK.getId(), action);     </pre>
    <pre>  action= new AddTaskAction(TextEditorMessages.getResourceBundle(), &quot;Editor.AddTask.&quot;, this); //$NON-NLS-1$
  action.setHelpContextId(ITextEditorHelpContextIds.ADD_TASK_ACTION);
  action.setActionDefinitionId(ITextEditorActionDefinitionIds.ADD_TASK);
  setAction(IDEActionFactory.ADD_TASK.getId(), action);</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>StatusTextEditor (package org.eclipse.ui.texteditor)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>See migration notes for AbstractTextEditor.</li>
  <li>StatusTextEditor provides the predicate method isErrorStatus(IStatus).
    Subclasses may override in order to decide whether a given status must
    considered an error or not.</li>
</ul>
<h4>ExtendedTextEditor (package org.eclipse.ui.editors.text)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The IEditorPart method gotoMarker(IMarker marker) has been deprecated to
    allow a future change of its visibility. Clients of this method must follow
    the migration instructions in the deprecation message.
  <li>ExtendedTextEditor returns an adapter for IGotoMarker.
  <li>ExtendedTextEditor implements the concept of implicit/explicit document
    providers previously provided by AbstractTextEditor. See migration notes for
    AbstractTextEditor.
</ul>
<h4>StorageDocumentProvider (package eclipse.ui.editors.text)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>See migration notes for AbstractDocumentProvider.</li>
  <li>Implements the getOperationRunner method defined by
    AbstractDocumentProvider. Always returns null. When subclassing you should
    not be affected by this change.</li>
</ul>
<h4>FileDocumentProvider (packge org.eclipse.ui.editors.text)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>See migration notes for AbstractDocumentProvider.</li>
  <li>The method resetDocument has been changed to doResetDocument.</li>
  <li>The method synchronize has been changed to doSynchronize.</li>
  <li>Implements the getOperationRunner method returning
    WorkspaceOperationRunner which executes given DocumentProviderOperations
    inside a WorkspaceModifyingOperation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Generic Console</h3>
<p>With the work for the generic console support, the view id for the console
has changed from org.eclipse.debug.ui.ConsoleView. This results in problems at
startup such as &quot;Could not restore workbench layout&quot; with details that
&quot;Could not create view: org.eclipse.debug.ui.ConsoleView&quot; for the
particular perspective that contained reference to the old view id. The
equivalent view id is now: &quot;org.eclipse.ui.console.ConsoleView&quot;.<br>
The generic console is available via the Window&gt;Show View&gt;Basic&gt;Console
and is used by the Eclipse debug and Ant integration.</p>
<h2><a name="Recommended Changes for 3.0">Recommended Changes for 3.0</a></h2>
<p>This section describes other changes that we recommend be made when porting
an existing plug-in to 3.0.</p>
<h3>Changes to API classes and interfaces (by package)</h3>
<h4>IWorkspaceRunnable and IWorkspace.run (org.eclipse.core.runtime)</h4>
<p>Clients of the <tt>IWorkspace.run(IWorkspaceRunnable,IProgressMonitor)</tt>
method should revisit their uses of this method and consider using the richer
method <tt>IWorkspace.run(IWorkspaceRunnable,ISchedulingRule,int,IProgressMonitor)</tt>.
The old <tt>IWorkspace.run</tt> method acquires a lock on the entire workspace
for the duration of the <tt>IWorkspaceRunnable</tt>. This means that an
operation run with this method will never be able to run concurrently with other
operations that are changing the workspace. In Eclipse 3.0, many long-running
operations have been moved into background threads, so the likelihood of
conflicts between operations is greatly increased. If a modal foreground
operation is blocked by a long-running background operation, the UI informs the
user that it is waiting for a background operation to complete.</p>
<p>The suggested solution is to switch all references to old <tt>IWorkspace.run</tt>
to use new method with scheduling rule parameter. The scheduling rule should be
the most fine-grained resource that encompasses all changes by that operation.
If desired, a <tt>MultiRule</tt> can be used to specify multiple resource rules.
If the operation tries to modify resources outside of the scope of the
scheduling rule, a runtime exception will occur. The following table summarizes
what scheduling rule is required for each of the different types of resource
operations:</p>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Type of operation</th>
      <th>Rule required</th>
    <tr>
      <td>Create, modify, or delete file or folder</td>
      <td>Parent resource</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Create, delete, open or close project</td>
      <td>Project</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Change project description</td>
      <td>Workspace root</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Refresh local</td>
      <td>Resource</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Create, delete, or modify marker</td>
      <td><tt>null</tt></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Create, delete or modify sync info</td>
      <td>Resource</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Build workspace or project</td>
      <td>Workspace root</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h4>IWorkbenchPage (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The constant EDITOR_ID_ATTR is now deprecated. This is an IMarker
    attribute name that specifies the preferred editor id to open the IMarker
    resource with. This constant in now on org.eclipse.ui.ide.IDE class.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IEditorDescriptor (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>There are new API methods to determine whether the editor will open
    internally to the workbench page (isInternal), in-place to the workbench
    window (isOpenInPlace), or externally to the workbench (isExternal). While
    this is not a breaking change, it is a good opportunity for clients that are
    illegally down-casting IEditorDescriptor to
    org.eclipse.ui.internal.model.EditorDescriptor to call isInternal to bring
    there code back into line.</li>
</ul>
<h4>ISharedImages (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following fields were removed (deprecated) from this interface because
    they were IDE-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>String IMG_OBJ_PROJECT</li>
      <li>String IMG_OBJ_PROJECT_CLOSED</li>
      <li>String IMG_OPEN_MARKER</li>
      <li>String IMG_OBJS_TASK_TSK</li>
      <li>String IMG_OBJS_BKMRK_TSK</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Existing clients should instead use the fields of the same names declared
    on IDE.SharedImages in the org.eclipse.ui.ide package of the
    org.eclipse.ui.ide plug-in.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IWorkbenchActionConstants (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following fields were removed (deprecated) from this interface; they
    are subsumed by the new ActionFactory class:
    <ul>
      <li>String BACK</li>
      <li>String CLOSE</li>
      <li>String CLOSE_ALL</li>
      <li>String COPY</li>
      <li>String CUT</li>
      <li>String DELETE</li>
      <li>String EXPORT</li>
      <li>String FIND</li>
      <li>String FORWARD</li>
      <li>String IMPORT</li>
      <li>String MOVE</li>
      <li>String NEW</li>
      <li>String NEXT</li>
      <li>String PASTE</li>
      <li>String PREVIOUS</li>
      <li>String PRINT</li>
      <li>String PROPERTIES</li>
      <li>String QUIT</li>
      <li>String REDO</li>
      <li>String REFRESH</li>
      <li>String RENAME</li>
      <li>String REVERT</li>
      <li>String SAVE</li>
      <li>String SAVE_ALL</li>
      <li>String SAVE_AS</li>
      <li>String SELECT_ALL</li>
      <li>String UNDO</li>
      <li>String UP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients should instead call getID() on the fields of the same names
    declared on ActionFactory in the org.eclipse.ui.actions package (org.eclipse.ui
    plug-in). For example, change IWorkbenchActionConstants.CUT to
    ActionFactory.CUT.getId().</li>
  <li>The following fields were removed (deprecated) from this interface because
    they were IDE-specific.
    <ul>
      <li>String ABOUT</li>
      <li>String ADD_TASK</li>
      <li>String BOOKMARK</li>
      <li>String BUILD</li>
      <li>String BUILD_PROJECT</li>
      <li>String CLOSE_PROJECT</li>
      <li>String FIND</li>
      <li>String OPEN_PROJECT</li>
      <li>String REBUILD_ALL</li>
      <li>String REBUILD_PROJECT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients should instead call getID() on the fields of the same names
    declared on IDEActionFactory in the org.eclipse.ui.ide package (org.eclipse.ui.ide
    plug-in). For example, change IWorkbenchActionConstants.BUILD to
    IDEActionFactory.BUILD.getId().</li>
</ul>
<h4>IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following fields were removed (deprecated) from this interface because
    they were IDE-specific:
    <ul>
      <li>String PROJECT_OPEN_NEW_PERSPECTIVE</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients should instead use the fields of the same names declared on
    IDE.Preferences in the org.eclipse.ui.ide package.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IExportWizard (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prior to 3.0, the selection passed to IWorkbenchWizard.init(IWorkbench,
    IStructuredSelection) for an export wizard was preprocessed. If any of the
    selections were IResources, or adaptable to IResource, then the selection
    consisted only of these resources. In 3.0, the generic export wizard does
    not do any preprocessing.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The selection passed to the wizard is generally used to prime the
    particular wizard page with contextually appropriate values.</li>
  <li>Client that implement IExportWizard and requires this resource-specific
    selection transformation should add the following to their init(IWorkbench,
    IStructuredSelection selection) method to computer <code>filteredSelection</code>
    from <code>selection</code>:
    <ul>
      <li><code>IStructuredSelection filteredSelection = selection;<br>
        List selectedResources = IDE.computeSelectedResources(currentSelection);<br>
        if (!selectedResources.isEmpty()) {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filteredSelection = new
        StructuredSelection(selectedResources);<br>
        }</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>IImportWizard (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prior to 3.0, the selection passed to IWorkbenchWizard.init(IWorkbench,
    IStructuredSelection) for an import wizard was preprocessed. If any of the
    selections were IResources, or adaptable to IResource, then the selection
    consisted only of these resources. In 3.0, the generic import wizard does
    not do any preprocessing.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The selection passed to the wizard is generally used to prime the
    particular wizard page with contextually appropriate values.</li>
  <li>Client that implement IImportWizard and requires this resource-specific
    selection transformation should add the following to their init(IWorkbench,
    IStructuredSelection selection) method to compute a filtered selection from
    the selection passed in:
    <ul>
      <li><code>IStructuredSelection filteredSelection = selection;<br>
        List selectedResources = IDE.computeSelectedResources(currentSelection);<br>
        if (!selectedResources.isEmpty()) {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filteredSelection = new
        StructuredSelection(selectedResources);<br>
        }</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>INewWizard (package org.eclipse.ui)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prior to 3.0, the selection passed to IWorkbenchWizard.init(IWorkbench,
    IStructuredSelection) for a new wizard was preprocessed. If there was no
    structured selection at the time the wizard was invoked, but the active
    workbench window had an active editor open on an IFile, then the selection
    passed in would consist of that IFile. In 3.0, the generic new wizard does
    not do any preprocessing, and an empty selection will be passed when there
    is no structured selection.</li>
  <li>The selection passed to the wizard is generally used to prime the
    particular wizard page with contextually appropriate values.</li>
  <li>Client that implement INewWizard and requires this capability should add
    the following to their init(IWorkbench, IStructuredSelection selection)
    method to compute a selection from the active editor's input:
    <pre>if (selection.isEmpty()) {
   IWorkbenchWindow window = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow();
   if (window != null) {
      IWorkbenchPart part = window.getPartService().getActivePart();
      if (part instanceof IEditorPart) {
         IEditorInput input = ((IEditorPart) part).getEditorInput();
         if (input instanceof IFileEditorInput) {
            selection = new StructuredSelection(((IFileEditorInput) input).getFile());
         }
      }		
  }
}</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>WorkbenchHelp (package org.eclipse.ui.help)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The following WorkbenchHelp method was removed (deprecated) from this
    class because its result (IHelp) was removed (deprecated):
    <ul>
      <li>public static IHelp getHelpSupport()</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients that called this method to obtain an IHelp should instead call the
    static methods on HelpSystem or WorkbenchHelp.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IHelp (package org.eclipse.help)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This interface has been removed (deprecated). WorkbenchHelp.getHelpsupport()
    was the only way to get hold of an IHelp object. This method has also been
    removed (deprecated).</li>
  <li>The following IHelp methods now appear as static methods on a new
    HelpSystem class in the same package:
    <ul>
      <li>public IToc[] getTocs()</li>
      <li>public IContext getContext(String contextId)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The rest of the IHelp methods now appear as static method on WorkbenchHelp.</li>
  <li>This interface was formerly mentioned in the contract for the
    org.eclipse.help.support extension point. This extension point has been
    renamed &quot;org.eclipse.ui.helpSupport&quot;, and the contract simplified
    so that the implementer only needs supply the display methods. For these
    purposes, IHelp has been replaced by AbstractHelpUI (in the
    org.eclipse.ui.help package).</li>
  <li>There should be no clients implementing this interface beyond the Platform
    which supplied the sole implementation of this interface.</li>
</ul>
<h4>ITextEditorActionConstants (package org.eclipse.ui.texteditor)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This interface additionally includes newly defined constants that redefine
    deprecated constants inherited from org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchActionConstants.
    This change allows clients to free their code from deprecation warnings. The
    constants ADD_TASK and BOOKMARK have not been redefined as they are IDE
    specific. When using these two constants in your code, please follow the
    instructions given in the deprecation message.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IAbstractTextEditorHelpContextIds (package org.eclipse.ui.texteditor)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>BOOKMARK_ACTION and ADD_TASK_ACTION have been deprecated because they are
    IDE specific. Use the constants defined in
    org.eclipse.ui.editors.text.ITextEditorHelpContextIds instead.</li>
</ul>
<h4>BasicTextEditorActionContributor (package org.eclipse.ui.texteditor)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>BasicTextEditorActionContributor no longer assigns any editor action as
    global action for org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchActionConstants.ADD_TASK and
    org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchActionConstants.BOOKMARK because these actions are
    IDE specific. This is now done by the
    org.eclipse.ui.editors.text.TextEditorActionContributor. If your editors are
    not configured to used TextEditorActionContributor but uses a contributor
    that is a subclass of BasicTextEditorActionContributor, this contributor has
    to be extended to also assign global action handlers for ADD_TASK and
    BOOKMARK. This can be done by adding the following lines to the
    setActiveEditor method of the editor action contributor:</li>
  <li>
    <pre> IActionBars actionBars= getActionBars();
 if (actionBars != null) {
   actionBars.setGlobalActionHandler(IDEActionFactory.ADD_TASK.getId(), getAction(textEditor, IDEActionFactory.ADD_TASK.getId()));
   actionBars.setGlobalActionHandler(IDEActionFactory.BOOKMARK.getId(), getAction(textEditor, IDEActionFactory.BOOKMARK.getId()));
 }</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>TextEditorActionContributor (package org.eclipse.ui.editors.text)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>TextEditorActionContributor assigns global action handlers for
    IWorkbenchActionConstants.ADD_TASK (now IDEActionFactory.ADD_TASK.getId())
    and IWorkbenchActionConstants.BOOKMARK (now IDEActionFactory.BOOKMARK.getId()).
    These action handlers have previously been registered by
    BasicTextEditorActionContributor. See migration notes for
    BasicTextEditorActionContributor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>ILaunchConfigurationType (package org.eclipse.debug.core)</h4>
<p>With the introduction of extensible launch modes in 3.0, more than one launch
delegate can exist for a launch configuration type. Releases prior to 3.0 only
supported one launch delegate per launch configuration type. The method <code>ILaunchConfigurationType.getDelegate()</code>
is now deprecated. The method <code>getDelegate(String mode)</code> should be
used in its place to retrieve the launch delegate for a specific launch mode.
The deprecated method has been changed to return the launch delegate for the <code>run</code>
mode.</p>
<h4>ILaunchConfigurationTab and ILaunchConfigurationTabGroup (package
org.eclipse.debug.ui)</h4>
<p>Launch tab groups and launch tabs are no longer notified when a launch
completes. The method <code>launched(ILaunch)</code> in the interfaces <code>ILaunchConfigurationTab</code>
and <code>ILaunchConfigurationTabGroup</code> has been deprecated and is no
longer called. Relying on this method for launch function was always
problematic, since tabs only exist when launching is performed from the launch
dialog. Also, with the introduction of background launching, this method can no
longer be called, as the launch dialog is be closed before the resulting launch
object exists.</p>
<h4>ILaunchConfigurationTab and AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab (package
org.eclipse.debug.ui)</h4>
<p>Two methods have been added to the <code>ILaunchConfigurationTab</code>
interface - activated and deactivated. These new life cycle methods are called
when a tab is entered and exited respectively. Existing implementations of <code>ILaunchConfigurationTab</code>
that subclass the abstract class provided by the debug plug-in (<code>AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab</code>)
are binary compatible since the methods are implemented in the abstract class.</p>
<p>In prior releases, a tab was sent the message <code>initializeFrom</code>
when it was activated, and <code>performApply</code> when it was deactivated. In
this way, the launch configuration tab framework provided inter-tab
communication via a launch configuration (by updating the configuration with
current attribute values when a tab is exited, and updating the newly entered
tab). However, since many tabs do not perform inter-tab communication, this can
be inefficient. As well, there was no way to distinguish between a tab being
activated, and a tab displaying a selected launch configuration for the first
time. The newly added methods allow tabs to distinguish between activation and
initialization, and deactivation and saving current values.</p>
<p>The default implementation of <code>activated</code>, provided by the
abstract tab, calls <code>initializeFrom</code>. And, the default implementation
of <code>deactivated</code> calls <code>performApply</code>. Tabs wishing to
take advantage of the new API should override these methods as required.
Generally, for tabs that do not perform inter-tab communication, the recommended
approach is to re-implement these methods to do nothing.</p>
<h4>launchConfigurationTabGroup extension point Type (package
org.eclipse.debug.ui)</h4>
<p>In prior releases, perspective switching was specified on a launch
configuration, via the launch configuration attributes <code>ATTR_TARGET_DEBUG_PERSPECTIVE</code>
and <code>ATTR_TARGET_RUN_PERSPECTIVE</code>. With the addition of extensible
launch modes in 3.0, this approach no longer scales. Perspective switching is
now specified on launch configuration type basis, per launch mode that a launch
configuration type supports. API has been added to <code>DebugUITools</code> to
set and get the perspective associated with a launch configuration type for a
specific launch mode.</p>
<p>An additional, optional, <code>launchMode</code> element has been added to
the <code>launchConfigurationTabGroup</code> extension point, allowing a
contributed tab group to specify a default perspective for a launch
configuration type and mode.</p>
<p>From the Eclipse user interface, users can edit the perspective associated
with a launch configuration type by opening the launch configuration dialog, and
selecting a launch configuration type node in the tree (rather than an
individual configuration). A tab is displayed allowing the user to set a
perspective with each supported launch mode.</p>
<h4>[JDT only] IVMRunner (package org.eclipse.jdt.launching)</h4>
<p>Two methods have been added to the <code>VMRunnerConfiguration</code> class
to support the setting and retrieving of environment variables. Implementors of <code>IVMRunner</code>
should call <code>VMRunnerConfiguration.getEnvironment()</code> and pass that
environment into the executed JVM. Clients who use <code>DebugPlugin.exec(String[]
cmdLine, File workingDirectory)</code> can do this by calling <code>DebugPlugin.exec(String[]
cmdLine, File workingDirectory, String[] envp)</code> instead. Simply passing in
the result from <code>getEnvironment()</code> is sufficient.</p>
<h4>[JDT only] VMRunnerConfiguration and Bootstrap Classes (package
org.eclipse.jdt.launching)</h4>
<p>In prior releases, the <code>VMRunnerConfiguration</code> had one attribute
to describe a boot path. The attribute is a collection of <code>Strings</code>
to be specified in the -<code>Xbootclasspath</code> argument. Three new
attributes have been added to the VMRunnerConfiguration to support JVMs that
allow for prepending and appending to the boot path. The new methods/attributes
added are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>getPrependBootClassPath()</code> - returns a collection of entries
    to be prepended to the boot path (the <code>-Xbootclasspath/p</code>
    argument)
  <li><code>getMainBootClassPath()</code> - returns a collection of entries to
    be placed on the boot path (the <code>-Xbootclasspath</code> argument)
  <li><code>getAppendBootClassPath()</code> - returns a collection of entries to
    be appended to the boot path (the <code>-Xbootclasspath/a</code> argument)</li>
</ul>
<p>The old attribute,<code> getBootClassPath()</code>, still exists and contains
a complete path equivalent to that of the three new attributes. However, <code>VMRunners</code>
that support the new boot path options should take advantage of the new
attributes.</p>
<h3>Restructuring of org.eclipse.help plug-in</h3>
<p>The org.eclipse.help plug-in, which used to hold APIs and extension points
for contributing to and extending help system, as well as displaying help, now
contains just APIs and extension points for contributing and accessing help
resources. A portion of default help UI implementation contained in that plug-in
has been moved to a new plug-in org.eclipse.help.base together with APIs for
extending the implementation. The APIs and extension point for contributing Help
UI and displaying help have been moved to org.eclipse.ui plug-in. This
restructuring allows applications greater flexibility with regard to the help
system; the new structure allows applications based on the generic workbench to
provide their own Help UI and/or Help implementation, or to omit the help system
entirely.</p>
<p>Because the extension points and API packages affected are intended only for
use by the help system itself, it is unlikely that existing plug-ins are
affected by this change. They are included here only for the sake of
completeness:</p>
<ul>
  <li>API packages org.eclipse.ui.help.browser and
    org.eclipse.ui.help.standalone, formerly provided by the org.eclipse.help
    plug-in, have been moved to the org.eclipse.help.base plug-in.</li>
  <li>Extension points org.eclipse.help.browser, org.eclipse.help.luceneAnalyzer,
    and org.eclipse.help.webapp, formerly defined by the org.eclipse.help
    plug-in, have been moved to the org.eclipse.help.base plug-in, with a
    corresponding change in extension point id.</li>
  <li>Extension point org.eclipse.help.support has been replaced by the
    org.eclipse.ui.helpSupport extension point. The contract for this extension
    point changed as well (see entry for IHelp).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Proposed Changes for 3.0">Proposed Changes for 3.0</a></h2>
<p>The following proposals are under discussion for inclusion in Eclipse 3.0.
They are mentioned here because the proposed changes impact existing plug-ins

<p>PDE provides a special wizard for converting 2.1 plug-in manifest to 3.0,
found at <b>PDE Tools &gt; Migrate to 3.0</b>. on the context menu for the

reflect the Platform restructuring.</p>
<h2><a name="General Information on Compatibility">General Information on
Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>Eclipse 3.0 is not fully compatible with 2.0 and 2.1. The nature and scope of
some of the key 3.0 plan items were such that the only feasible solutions break
compatibility. The decision to make these breaking changes was done after open
discussion with the community. That said, most of the Eclipse APIs are the same
in 3.0 as in 2.1 and 2.0. We have only broken APIs in 3.0 when there is a
compelling case for doing so, and have tried to do it in a controlled way that
minimizes the effort required to port an existing plug-in to the 3.0 APIs.</p>
<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 is upwards
contract-compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0 and 2.1 except in those areas noted in
this document. Programs that use affected APIs and extension points will need to
be ported to Eclipse SDK 3.0 APIs (API is construed broadly to include such
things as plug-in extension points.) Downward contract compatibility is not
supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.0 APIs would
ensure compliance with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 APIs. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain contract compatibility.
<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 is upwards
binary-compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0 and 2.1 except in those areas noted in
this document. Plug-ins that use affected APIs and extension points will need to
be ported and recompiled for Eclipse SDK 3.0. Downward plug-in compatibility is
not supported either. Plug-ins for Eclipse SDK 3.0 will not be usable in Eclipse
SDK 2.0 or 2.1. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain binary compatibility.
<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 is upwards source-compatible
with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 except in the areas noted in this document. This
means that source files written to use Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 APIs might
successfully compile and run against Eclipse SDK 3.0 APIs, although this is not
guaranteed. Downward source compatibility is not supported. If source files use
new Eclipse SDK APIs, they will not be usable with an earlier version of the
Eclipse SDK.
<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 is upwards
workspace-compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 unless noted. This means that
workspaces and projects created with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 can be successfully
opened by Eclipse SDK 3.0 and upgraded to a 3.0 workspace. This includes both
hidden metadata, which is localized to a particular workspace, as well as
metadata files found within a workspace project (e.g., the .project file), which
may propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories.
Individual plug-ins developed for Eclipse SDK 3.0 should provide similar upwards
compatibility for their hidden and visible workspace metadata created by earlier
versions; 3.0 plug-in developers are responsible for ensuring that their
plug-ins recognize 3.0, 2.1, and 2.0 metadata and process it appropriately. User
interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is upgraded. Downward
workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created (or opened) by
Eclipse SDK 3.0 will be unusable with an earlier version of Eclipse
SDK.&nbsp;Visible metadata files created (or overwritten) by Eclipse SDK 3.0
will generally be unusable with earlier versions of Eclipse SDK.
<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and
certainly everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are
considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
on anything other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently
unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
release much less with an earlier releases. Refer to <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant
plug-ins. This porting guide does not cover non-API methods and classes.</p>
