<h1>Installing the stand-alone help system</h1>
<p>If you are creating an application that is not based on 
the Eclipse framework, you can still use the Eclipse help system. Your 
application can package and install the stand-alone help system, a very small 
version of Eclipse that has  everything except the help system stripped out 
of it. Then, your application can make API calls from its Help menu, or from UI 
objects, to launch the help browser. The stand-alone help system has all the 
features of the integrated help system, except infopops and active help. When an application is not Java based, or help is required when the application is not running, it is possible to use stand-alone help from a system shell, a shell script or a desktop shortcut and provide command line options instead of calling Java APIs.</p>
<P>The stand-alone help system allows passing number of options that can be used to customize various aspects of the help system. The following options are supported:</P><UL>
	<LI><B>-eclipsehome</B> <I>eclipseInstallPath</I> - specifies Eclipse
	installation directory. It must be provided, when current directory from which infocenter is launched, is
	not the same as Eclipse installation directory.</LI>
	<LI><B>-host</B> <I>helpServerHost</I> - specifies host name of the
	interface that help server will use. It overrides host name specified
	the application server plugin preferences.</LI>

	<LI><B>-port</B> <I>helpServerPort</I> - specifies port number that
	help server will use. It overrides port number specified the
	application server plugin preferences.</LI>
	<LI><B>-servertimeout</B> <I>timeout</I> - number of seconds waiting
	to connect to the help server while executing commands,
	such as shutdown.  Default is 40s.  You may need to
	use this option when running from a slow media such as a CD-ROM.</LI>
	<LI>Additionally, most <A
		href="../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/running_eclipse.htm">options
	accepted by Eclipse executable</A> can be passed. They are especially useful during debugging and for applying customization to Eclipse.</LI>
</UL>
<h2><b>Installation/packaging</b> </h2>
These steps are for the help system 
  integrator and are not meant to address all the possible scenarios. It is 
  assumed   that 
  all your documentation is delivered as Eclipse plug-ins and, in general, you are 
  familiar with the eclipse help system.
<ol>
  <li>Download the Eclipse Platform Runtime Binary driver from
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">www.eclipse.org</a>.</li>
  <li>Install (unzip) the driver under your application directory, for 
  example, <var>d:\myApp</var>. This will create an eclipse subdirectory, d:\myApp\eclipse that 
  contains the code required for the Eclipse platform (which includes the help 
  system). </li>
</ol>
<h2><b>How to call the help classes from Java</b></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure <em><span style="font-style: normal">d:\myApp\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.help_2.1.0\help.jar</span></em> is 
  on your app classpath. The class you use to start, launch, and shut down the help system is 
  org.eclipse.help.standalone.Help. </li>
  <li>Create an array of String containing options that you want to pass to help system support. Typically, the eclipsehome option is needed.
  <PRE><EM><SPAN style="font-style: normal">String[] options = new String[] { &quot;-eclipsehome&quot;, &quot;d:\\myApp\\eclipse&quot; };</SPAN></EM> </PRE></li>
	<LI>In your application, create an instance of the Help class by
	passing the options. This object should be held onto until
	the end of your application.<PRE><EM><SPAN style="font-style: normal">Help helpSystem = new Help(options);</SPAN></EM> </PRE>
	</LI>
	<li>To start the help system:
  <pre><em><span style="font-style: normal">helpSystem.start();</span></em> </pre>
  <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>To invoke help when needed:
  <pre><em><span style="font-style: normal">helpSystem.displayHelp();</span></em> </pre>
  <p>You can also call help on specific primary TOC files or topics:</p>
  <pre>helpSystem.displayHelp(&quot;/com.mycompany.mytool.doc/toc.xml&quot;);
helpSystem.displayHelp(&quot;/com.mycompany.mytool.doc/tasks/task1.htm&quot;);</pre>
  </li>
  <li>To launch context sensitive help, call 
  helpSystem.displayContext(contextId, x, y) where contextId is a fully 
  qualified context id. The screen coordinates, x and y, are not currently used.
  </li>
	<LI>
	<P>At the end of your application, to shutdown the help system:</P>
	<PRE><EM><SPAN style="font-style: normal">helpSystem.shutdown();</SPAN></EM> </PRE></LI>
</ol>
<h2><b>How to call the help from command line</b> </h2>
<p>The org.eclipse.help.standalone.Help class has a  main method that you 
can use to launch stand-alone help from a command 
line. The command line arguments syntax is:</p>
<pre><em><span style="font-style: normal">-command start | shutdown | (displayHelp [href]) [-eclipsehome eclipseInstallPath] [-host helpServerHost] [-port helpServerPort] [-servertimeout timeout] [platform options] [-vmargs JavaVMarguments]</span></em></pre>
<P>A simple way to display help is to invoke</P>
<pre>java -classpath d:\myApp\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.help_2.1.0\help.jar org.eclipse.help.standalone.Help -command displayHelp</pre><P>from within d:\myApp directory. To display specific TOC file or topic use</P>

<PRE>java -classpath d:\myApp\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.help_2.1.0\help.jar org.eclipse.help.standalone.Help -command displayHelp /com.mycompany.mytool.doc/tasks/task1.htm</PRE>
<P>The calls above to display help will cause help system to start, display help, and keep running to allow a user to continue browsing  help after the command is executed. To control the life cycle of the help system, use start and shutdown commands, in addition to the displayHelp command. For example, you may call</P>
<PRE>java -classpath d:\myApp\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.help_2.1.0\help.jar org.eclipse.help.standalone.Help -command startup</PRE>
