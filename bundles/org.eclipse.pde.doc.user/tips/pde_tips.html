<h2>PDE Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>[This section should make interesting bathroom reading for an end user of
Eclipse 2.1. It should give them bits of advice on how to use Eclipse
effectively. It should stay away for things that a user would naturally discover
while using Eclipse, and instead focus on high-value things that they might not
have noticed. It also differs in tone from the &quot;New for 2.1&quot; section
in that it deals with anything in 2.1, not just the new stuff. Each item should
stand by itself (as they would have to if we had a &quot;Tip of the Day&quot;
facility).]</p>
<p>[This section needs work. The material here is lifted from the M2 through M5
&quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; bulletins. Some of the items might make good Tips
and Tricks.]</p>

    <td valign="top" align="right"><b>Support for feature-based self-hosting</b></td>
    <td valign="top" align="left">The current method of self-hosting in Eclipse
      is plug-in-based. PDE launches a second run-time workbench instance by
      passing an array of plug-ins that it should load. A regular Eclipse
      product is feature-based: during startup, it checks all the features that
      should be active, computes plug-ins that belong to those features, and
      passes the result for loading.
      <p>This difference in behavior makes it complicated to self-host in
      scenarios where a full startup that involves features is required. PDE now
      supports this scenario if care is taken with the setup:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The workspace needs to be &lt;work-area&gt;/plugins.</li>
        <li>Features must be imported into the workspace using the new 'Feature
          Import' wizard (they will be created in &lt;work-area&gt;/features).</li>
        <li>All plug-ins must be in the workspace (either in source or imported
          as binary projects).</li>
        <li>When launching, Run-time Workbench launcher must be configured to
          use features (in Plug-ins and Fragments tab).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If all these conditions are met, the runtime Eclipse instance will be
      launched in a way that is the closest possible approximation of a normal
      Eclipse startup. This facilitates testing About dialogs and other aspects
      that may depend on the set of installed features.</td>

    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Plug-in dependency extent</b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">You can now discover the extent to
      which one plug-in depends on another. The <b>Compute Dependency Extent </b>operation
      found on the context menu in several contexts (including manifest file
      Dependencies page and Dependencies view) performs a combined Java and
      plug-in search to find all external types and extension points referenced
      by the plug-in. When a type is selected in the Search results view, the <b>References
      in <i>MyPlugIn</i></b> action in the context menu searches for the places
      in the plug-in where the selected type is referenced.&nbsp;
      <p>The dependency extent facility is useful for identifying cases of extra
      required plug-ins (0 types found), and aiding code refactoring between
      plug-ins.</td>

    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">A new view can be opened by
      selecting a plug-in manifest file (<code> plugin.xml</code>) and choosing <b>Open
      Dependencies</b> from the context menu. This view allows you to browse the
      plug-ins it requires, the ones they require, and so on.</td>

    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">Select a plug-in in the Plug-ins
      view and choose <b>Add to Java Search</b> from the context menu to include
      the plug-in's JAR libraries in Java searches. This is handy for remaining
      aware of other plug-ins that depend on ones you're working on.</td>

    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Plug-ins should declare
      package prefixes</b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">A significant (10-15%) speed
      increase in the time to load a plug-in's classes can be obtained simply by
      declaring the package name prefixes found in that plug-in's runtime
      library JARs. This is done in the new Package Prefixes section of the
      Runtime page in the PDE plug-in manifest editor. (Further information <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-core-home/docs/package-prefixes/prefixes.html">here</a>.)
