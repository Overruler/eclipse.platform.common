<p class="style1">Plug-ins Tab</p>
<p>The <strong>Plug-ins Tab</strong> allows you to select the plug-ins (aka. bundles) and their start level, thus customizing the <strong>osgi.bundles</strong> and <strong>osgi.bundles.defaultStartLevel</strong> system properties that the launch configuration will run with. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/launchers/launcher_equinox_plugins.png" alt="Equinox Plug-ins" hspace="30"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Default Start Level</p>
<p>A start level is a positive integer that denotes the default OSGi start level at which a bundle will run. The <strong>default start level</strong>, which will be assigned to all selected bundles, is initially set to <strong>4</strong>. This master setting can be changed directly to modify the start level of bundles <em>en masse</em>, or it can be overridden on a per-bundle basis. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Default Start Status</p>
<p>The  start status indicates to the framework whether a bundle should be marked as active after it gets installed. If set to true (the default), a bundle will always be started when the framework is launched. The <strong>default start status</strong> is a master setting that is applied to all selected bundles en masse, but it can be overridden on a per-bundle basis. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Bundle Selection</p>
<p>Bundles  that are to be installed by the framework upon startup must be explicitly checked on this page. By default, a bundle will be assigned the default start level and the default start status, but these values can be overridden on a per-bundle basis by selecting the bundle and editing the start level and status in-place. </p>
<p>There are several buttons available to help you select plug-ins including an <STRONG>Add Required Plug-ins</STRONG>, which you should use often to make sure   the subset of plug-ins you have selected is complete. </p>
<p>Note that if a workspace bundle has the same ID as a bundle in the target,   the workspace bundle masks the target counterpart. This behavior  can be overridden, since you have the ability to deselect a   workspace bundle and select its target counterpart. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Validate Plug-in Set</p>
<p>The <STRONG>Validate Plug-in Set</STRONG> functionality, which can be invoked   via the button located at the bottom right corner of the <STRONG>Plug-ins   tab</STRONG>, analyzes the selected set of plug-ins to find lurking launching   startup problems. Missing dependencies, unsatisfied execution environments,   incompatible platform filters are a few of the potential problems that may   prevent your plug-in from running and which can be forecasted by this   function.</p>
<p>By checking the <STRONG>Validate plug-in dependencies automatically prior to   launching</STRONG> option, this function is run by PDE prior to every launch. If   problems are found, a dialog showing the error comes up for you to examine the   problems. You have the option to continue the launch without correcting the   problems or canceling the launch to rectify the issues and relaunch. If no   problems are found, the launch proceeds as normal. </p>
