<p class="style1">Configuration Tab</p>
<p>The <strong>Configuration Tab</strong> is an advanced tab that lets you override the default configuration area location and the <em>config.ini</em> file content of the runtime Eclipse application you are testing. </p>
<p class="style1"><img src="../../images/launchers/launcher_eclipse_configuration.png" alt="Configuration tab" hspace="30"> </p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Configuration Area</p>
<p>Every Eclipse application instance has a unique configuration area which contains metadata, caches and configuration files read by the runtime and Update Manager upon startup.</p>
<p>Typically, the location of the configuration is not important and the user needs not to worry about its contents. PDE therefore generates a unique configuration area for every launch in its own metadata area. This configuration area is deleted when the launch configuration is deleted.</p>
<p>The location of the configuration area can be set by the user, if desired. Variables in the directory path are supported, thus making launch configurations sharable among team members.</p>
<p>You also have the option to clear the configuration area prior to launching, which you may find useful if you are testing how plug-ins cache data in that area. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Configuration File</p>
<p> Upon startup, the runtime reads a configuration file named <em>config.ini</em> located in a <em>configuration/</em> subdirectory of the configuration area associated with the Eclipse application instance. This file is a standard properties file that can configure many aspects of the runtime. For a full list of the supported properties, refer to the <a href="../../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/runtime-options.html">Eclipse runtime options</a> document.</p>
<p>The <strong>Generate a config.ini file with default content</strong> is the default option and is recommended unless you have some very specific needs.  When this option is selected, PDE generates a config.ini file with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>osgi.bundles</strong> - listing all the bundles that should be installed and optionally started once the system is up and running. This list is based on the osgi.bundles key found in the <em>${target_home}/configuration/config.ini</em> file, where $[target_home} is the location of the target platform.</li>
  <li><strong>osgi.bundles.defaultStartLevel</strong> - the value is set to <strong>4</strong> and denotes that default OSGi start level at which a bundle should start.</li>
  <li><strong>osgi.configuration.cascaded</strong> - the value is set to false, indicating that this configuration is standalone and that there is no parent configuration to cascade to. </li>
  <li><strong>osgi.framework</strong> - the URL to the location of the <em>org.eclipse.osgi</em> plug-in</li>
  <li><strong>osgi.install.area</strong> - the location of the target platform. </li>
  <li><strong>osgi.splashPath</strong> - the location(s) of the splash screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Use an existing config.ini file as a template</strong> option takes an existing config.ini and makes a copy of it. PDE does not add nor remove any properties from the file. It only modifies the <strong>osgi.bundles</strong> and <strong>osgi.splashPath</strong> keys by substituting the generic bundle URLs in these two keys with absolute paths that reflect the bundles' actual locations on disk.</p>
