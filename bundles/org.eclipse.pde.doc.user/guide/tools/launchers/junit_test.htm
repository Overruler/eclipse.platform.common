<p class="style1">Test Tab</p>
<p>The <strong>Test Tab</strong> specifies the tests to run and the level of JUnit test runner to use. </p>

<p class="style2">Tests to Run</p>
<p>The <em>JUnit Plug-in Test</em> launcher allows you to run single tests or collections of tests <em>en masse</em>. </p>
<p>If the individual test option is chosen, you have to specify the fully-qualified test class name along with the name of the plug-in project where the class is located. The launcher can give you more granularity for single tests by allowing you to choose to run a single method from within a test class.</p>
<p>You also have the option to run all tests housed within a container (project, package or a source folder). In addition to the convenience of running an arbitrary number of test cases with a single click, this option gives you the additional flexibility of not having to update the launch configuration every time you add a test class to your suite. The list of tests is dynamically recomputed prior to every launch based on the current contents of the container. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Test Runner</p>
<p>Eclipse provides two JUnit test runners:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>JUnit 3</strong>: uses <em>JUnit 3.8.1</em>. This is the default test runner. </li>
  <li><strong>JUnit 4</strong>:   uses <em>JUnit 4.1.0</em> and is available only if you are running Eclipse with a JRE version that is greater than or equal to 1.5.</li>
</ul>
