<p class="style1">Plug-ins  </p>
<p>The <strong>Plug-ins View</strong> shows a unified view of all the plug-ins you are developing in the workspace and the plug-ins that make up your target platform. The view <strong></strong> is available under <strong>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other... &gt; PDE &gt; Plug-ins</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/views/plugin_1.png" alt="Plug-ins View" hspace="30"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Workspace Plug-ins</p>
<p>A workspace plug-in is shown in the view with a yellow project icon. Its content is not shown because the view is not intended to duplicate the behaviour of the <em>Navigator</em> and <em>Package Explorer</em> views. Double-click on the plug-in to open its manifest file in the PDE plug-in manifest editor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Target Plug-ins</p>
<p>A target plug-in is shown in the view with the regular blue plug-in icon (or purple, in the case of a fragment). If the plug-in is JARd, it is not expandable. Flat plug-ins, on the other hand, are expandable and you can browse their structure and content. Double-click on the JARd plug-in or one of the manifest files of a flat plug-in to open its manifest file in the PDE plug-in manifest editor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Actions</p>
<p>Several useful actions are available in the context menu of plug-ins in the Plug-ins view:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Open Dependencies</strong>: opens the <a href="plugin_dependencies.htm">Plug-in Dependencies</a> view to show hierarchical and tabular renderings of the selected plug-in's relationship to other plug-ins</li>
  <li><strong>Find References</strong>: finds all references to this plug-in by other plug-ins and display the results in the Search view.</li>
  <li><strong>Importing</strong>: provides a quick way to import a plug-in into the workspace.</li>
  <li><strong>Add to Java Search</strong>: adds the code found in the selected plug-in to the scope of the Java search engine without the need to import the plug-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Filtering</p>
<p>Several filters are available in the view's toolbar drop down meny to show and hide workspace and disabled target plug-ins.</p>
