<p class="style1">Product Export</p>
<p>PDE provides an <strong>Eclipse Product Export</strong> wizard to export an Eclipse product defined in a <em>product configuration</em>. The wizard shields you from Ant scripts and does not pollute your workspace with resources generated during the build operation. The wizard is available under <strong>File &gt; Export... &gt; Plug-in Development &gt; Eclipse Product</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Product Configuration</p>
<p>The <em>Eclipse Product</em> export  wizard is centered around the <a href="../file_wizards/new_product_config.htm">product configuration</a>, which encapsulates all the data that the wizard needs to build the plug-ins and features and generate all the configuration files that are necessary to run the product. </p>
<p>The <strong>Browse...</strong> button lets you browse all the .product files in the workspace and select the <em>product configuration</em> that will guide the build process. </p>
<p>The <strong>root directory</strong> is the name of the top level directory of the packaged product. It is set to <em>eclipse</em> by default, but can be changed to any name, including names with more than one segment. For example, if the root directory is set to <em>rcp/product</em>, the product executable will be placed in a directory named <em>rcp/product</em>, and so does the <em>plugins/</em> directory. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Synchronization</p>
<p>The product configuration is used by PDE only to help create and customize a product. For some of the data stored in the product configuration to take effect at runtime (e.g. window images, <em>About dialog</em> image and text, etc.), these properties must be written to the org.eclipse.core.runtime.products extension in the product defining plug-in's manifest file. </p>
<p>The Synchronization option, which is <em>on</em> by default, ensures that the plug-in manifest files are up-to-date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Destination</p>
<p>The option to export to a <strong>directory</strong> is the default. The product <strong>root directory</strong> is placed directly at the specified directory. </p>
<p>When the option to export to an <strong>archive file</strong> is selected, the product is packaged in a ZIP archive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Source Code </p>
<p>The <strong>Include source code</strong> option results in the exporting of source code as well as binaries. If a plug-in is packaged as JAR, the source code will be placed in a <em>src/</em> folder at the root of the JAR. If the plug-in is packaged as a flat directory, the source code will be placed in a source ZIP inside the plug-in directory as a sibling to the library JAR. Refer to the <a href="../preference_pages/source_code_locations.htm">Source Code Locations</a> document for details on the source archive naming convention. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">One-Click Cross-Platform Export</p>
<p>The <strong>Export for multiple platforms</strong> option is only available when PDE detects that the RCP delta pack is installed in the target platform. When this option is selected, a second wizard page becomes available displaying the list of available platforms. This list is compiled by navigating the directory structure of the installed <em>org.eclipse.platform.launchers</em> feature to retrieve the different platform combinations. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/export_wizards/cross_platform.PNG" alt="Cross Platform Export" hspace="30"> </p>
<p>In a single operation, PDE generates a product for each selected platform and places it in a directory whose name is of the form <em>&lt;os&gt;_&lt;ws&gt;_&lt;arch&gt;</em>, where <em>os</em> is the selected operating system, <em>ws</em> is the selected windowing system, and <em>arch</em> is the selected processor architecture.</p>
