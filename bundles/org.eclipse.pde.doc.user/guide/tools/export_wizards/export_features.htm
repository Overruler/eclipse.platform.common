<p class="style1">Feature Export</p>
<p>PDE provides a <strong>Feature Export</strong> wizard to export features and constituent plug-ins and fragments into a form that is suitable for deployment. The wizard shields you from Ant scripts and does not pollute your workspace with resources generated during the build operation. The wizard is available under <strong>File &gt; Export... &gt; Plug-in Development &gt; Deployable features </strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Feature Selection </p>
<p>The wizard displays all the non-binary features found in the workspace. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/export_wizards/feature_available.png" alt="Feature Selection" hspace="30"></p>
<p>Select the features that you want to export. If you find yourself exporting the same set of features over and over, you can press <strong>Working Set...</strong> to define a <em> working set</em>. </p>
<p>Features are built recursively; so if you have two features where one feature is included in another, you only need to select the top-level feature if you want to export both. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Destination</p>
<p>You can choose to export the features and their constituent plug-ins to a directory or to a ZIP archive. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/export_wizards/destination.png" alt="Destination" hspace="30"></p>
<p>If you choose to export to a <strong>directory</strong> (the default), the features will be placed in a <em>features/</em> subdirectory and the plug-ins will be placed in a <em>plugins/</em> subdirectory of the chosen directory.</p>
<p>If you choose to export to an <strong>archive</strong>, all the features and plug-ins will be packaged in a single ZIP archive. The directory structure inside the ZIP also starts with <em>features/</em> and <em>plugins/</em> at its root. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Options</p>
<p><img src="../../images/export_wizards/options.png" alt="Options" hspace="30"></p>
<p>The <strong>Include source code</strong> option results in the exporting of source code as well as binaries. If a plug-in is packaged as JAR, the source code will be placed in a <em>src/</em> folder at the root of the JAR. If the plug-in is packaged as a flat directory, the source code will be placed in a source ZIP inside the plug-in directory as a sibling to the library JAR. Refer to the <a href="../preference_pages/source_code_locations.htm">Source Code Locations</a> document for details on the source archive naming convention. </p>
<p>The <strong>Package as individual archives</strong> option packages features and their plug-ins as JARs. If the option is not selected, then the features are exported as flat directories, while their constituent plug-ins are packaged as specified in the <em>feature.xml</em> markup. Plug-in entries that are marked with <em><strong>unpack=&quot;false&quot;</strong></em> in the <em>feature.xml</em> are exported as JARs; otherwise, they are exported as directories. </p>
<p>The <strong>Save as Ant script</strong> option lets you save the settings of the export operation so that it can be re-executed without having to go through the wizard all over again. The Ant task will run as an asynchronous job, exactly as does the export operation itself; so it may not be suitable to incorporate it as a part of a larger Ant script. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">JAR Signing </p>
<p>The <strong>JAR Signing</strong> tab is only visible when the <strong>Package as individual JAR archives</strong> option is selected on the <strong>Options</strong> tab. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/export_wizards/jar_signing.png" alt="JAR Signing" hspace="30"></p>
<p>To sign the JARs, <em><strong>you must be running Eclipse with a full JDK, not a JRE. </strong></em></p>
<p>The <strong>keystore location</strong>, <strong>alias</strong> and <strong>password</strong> are all required fields</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Java Web Start</p>
<p>The <strong>Java Web Start</strong> tab is only available when the <strong>Directory</strong> option is selected on the <strong>Destination</strong> tab and the <strong>Package as individual archives</strong> option is selected on the <strong>Options</strong> tab. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/export_wizards/webstart.png" alt="Java Web Start" hspace="30"> .</p>
<p>The <strong>site URL</strong> and <strong>JRE version</strong> are both required fields.</p>
