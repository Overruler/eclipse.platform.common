<p class="style1">Target Plug-ins</p>
<p>The <strong>Plug-ins</strong> tab shows all the plug-ins found in the specified target location. Only plug-ins that are checked on the tab constitute the target content. Unchecked plug-ins are ignored by PDE. By default, all plug-ins in the target are checked. </p>
<p>If, for example, you are doing RCP development, it would be a good idea to select only the subset of plug-ins that make up the RCP feature. This way, other plug-ins in the target will not be part of your target and you will not accidentally reference plug-ins from outside the RCP subset. </p>

<p>The <strong>Plug-ins</strong> tab has several buttons to help with the selection of plug-ins, including the <strong>Add Required Plug-ins</strong> button. When this button is pressed, PDE scans all the checked plug-ins in the table, recursively goes through their dependencies and checks any dependency that is not already checked. </p>
