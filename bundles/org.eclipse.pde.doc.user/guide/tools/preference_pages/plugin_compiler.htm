<p class="style1">Plug-in Compiler Preferences</p>
<p>Syntactic errors in plugin.xml, fragment.xml and MANIFEST.MF are all flagged as errors by the plug-in manifest compiler. As for semantic problems in the plug-in manifests, the severity for each problem category can be set to <em>Error</em>, <em>Warning</em> or <em>Ignore</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Workspace vs. Project Settings </p>
<p>The plug-in compiler preferences are set at a workspace level on the <strong>Plug-in Development &gt; Compilers</strong> preference page and take effect on all plug-in projects in the workspace. </p>
<p>It is also possible to override the workspace-scope settings by having compiler settings at the plug-in project level. To do so, select <strong>Properties</strong> from the context menu of a plug-in project. In the <strong>Properties</strong> dialog, project-level manifest compiler settings can be customized on the <strong>Plug-in Development &gt; Plug-in Manifest Compiler</strong> preference page.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style2">Semantic Problems </p>
<p>PDE validates plugin.xml, fragment.xml, MANIFEST.MF and build.properties files to flag a variety of potential problems that may prevent the plug-in from running properly. </p>
<p>Note that some problems such as a missing plug-in ID, plug-in version, or plug-in name render a plug-in invalid. Therefore, these problems are flagged with a non-negotiable error marker. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/preferences_compilers_plugin.png" alt="Plug-in Compiler Options" hspace="30"></p>
<p>The following is a brief explanation for some of the non-obvious potential problems that are flagged by PDE: </p>
<ul>
  <li><u><strong>Unresolved Dependencies:</strong></u> An unresolved dependency is a dependency on a plug-in (in the <strong>Require-Bundle</strong> MANIFEST.MF header) or on a package (in the <strong>Import-Package</strong> MANIFEST.MF header) where the plug-in or package in question does not exist.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Incompatible Environment:</u></strong> A plug-in or fragment has an incompatible environment if it has an <strong>Eclipse-PlatformFilter</strong> MANIFEST.MF header whose value is not compatible with the current Target Environment settings as they appear on the <strong>Plug-in Development &gt; Target Platform &gt; Environment</strong> preference page.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Unresolved Extension Points:</u></strong> An unresolved extension point is an extension point that does not exist or whose contributing plug-in is unchecked on the <strong>Plug-in Development &gt; Target Platform</strong> preference page. Extensions contributing to such an extension point are flagged. </li>
</ul>
