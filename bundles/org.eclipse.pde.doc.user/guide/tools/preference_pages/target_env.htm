<p class="style1">Target Environment</p>
<p>The <strong>Target Environment</strong> tab defines the operating system, windowing syste, architecture and locale for which you are developing your plug-ins.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/preferences_target_environment.png" alt="Target Environment" hspace="30"></p>
<p>Typically, a plug-in is agnostic to its environment and should run in all environments. However, if you have platform-specific resources/code, it is recommended to package them in a plug-in fragment, where the fragment declares the platform with which it is compatible.</p>
<p>For example, the org.eclipse.ui.win32 fragment has the following filter in its MANIFEST.MF: </p>
<p>Eclipse-PlatformFilter: (ws=win32)</p>
<p>This filter indicates that the org.eclipse.ui.win32 fragment is designed to run only on platforms with a win32 windowing system. If Eclipse is running on a platform that does not meeting this requirement, the fragment will be silently ignored by the runtime. </p>
