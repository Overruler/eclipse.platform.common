<p class="style1">Configuration</p>
<p>The <strong>Configuration</strong> page defines the content of the product and the configuration file needed to run the product. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Content</p>
<p>If the product is plugin-based, the <strong>Configuration</strong> page shows a <strong>Plug-ins and Fragments</strong> section where you list all the plug-ins that will make up the product. This section also provides <strong>New Plugin...</strong> and <strong>New Fragment...</strong> buttons to enable you to create new plug-ins and fragments on the fly. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/product_editor/configuration_plugins.png" alt="Configuration Plug-ins" hspace="30"> </p>
<p>If the product is feature-based, the <strong>Configuration</strong> page shows a <strong>Features</strong> section where you list all the features that will make up the product. This section also provides a <strong>New Feature...</strong> button to enable you to create new features on the fly.</p>

<p class="style2">Configuration File </p>
<p>Upon startup, the runtime reads a configuration file named <EM>config.ini</EM> located in a <EM>configuration/</EM> subdirectory of the   configuration area of an Eclipse product. This file   is a standard properties file that can configure many aspects of the runtime.   For a full list of the supported properties, refer to the <A href="../../../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/runtime-options.html">Eclipse   runtime options</A> document.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/product_editor/configuration_file.png" alt="Configuration File" hspace="30"></p>
<p>The <STRONG>Generate a default config.ini file </STRONG>is the   default option and is recommended unless you have some very specific needs. When   this option is selected, PDE generates a <EM>config.ini</EM> file with the   following properties:</p>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>osgi.bundles</STRONG> - lists all the bundles that should be   installed and optionally started once the system is up and running. This list is   based on the <EM>osgi.bundles</EM> key found in the <EM>${target_home}/configuration/config.ini</EM> file. (Note, the ${target_home}   variable is the location of the target platform).   
  <LI><STRONG>osgi.bundles.defaultStartLevel</STRONG> - denotes the default OSGi   start level at which a bundle should start. The default value is set to <STRONG>4.</STRONG>
  <LI><STRONG>eclipse.product</STRONG> - specifies the ID of the product to launch. <LI><STRONG>osgi.splashPath</STRONG> - specifies one or more locations of the   splash screen. </LI>
</UL>
<p>You also have the option to <strong>use an existing config.ini file</strong> which will be copied by PDE to your final product as-is.</p>
