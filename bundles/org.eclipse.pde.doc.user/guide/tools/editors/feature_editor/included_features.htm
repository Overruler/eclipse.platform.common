<p>The Included Features reference all features nested inside this feature and their properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Feature List</p>
<p>The feature list enumerates all the features that are directly nested and therefore considered part of this feature. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/features_included.png" alt="Included Features" width="256" height="135"></p>
<p>When the feature is built, all included features are recursively built and   packaged.</p>

<p>An included feature may be marked as <strong>optional</strong>. Users may choose to not install optional features. They may also choose to disable them if they are   installed or install them later. A missing optional feature is not treated as   an error.</p>
<p>An included feature can be updated by patches. By default, Update Manager searches for updates to an included feature at the update site for the parent feature, but this setting can be overridden. </p>
<p>If an included feature contains platform-specific code or resources, then environment   conditions should be specified and associated with that feature.</p>
