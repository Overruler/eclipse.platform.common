<p class="style1">Content</p>
<p>The <strong>Content</strong> page defines the contents of the target
 definition.  The contents can consist of both features and plug-ins. 
 The specified plug-ins, as well as plug-ins required by the specified
 features, will be enabled when the target is loaded.
</p>

<p>The <strong>Include all plug-ins from the specified target</strong>
 option allows you to conveniently add any and all plug-ins which
 are found in the target's locations.  This can be helpful when target
 platforms are frequently adding and removing plug-ins.
</p>

<p class="style2">Plug-ins</p>

 working set into your target definition. 
 You may also use the <strong>Add Required Plug-ins</strong> button to add
 additional plug-ins which are required by the current list of specified
 plug-ins.

 required plug-ins</strong>.
