<p class="style1">Build</p>
<p>The <strong>Build </strong>page contains all the information needed to   build, package and export the plug-in.&nbsp; Although it appears as a page in the plug-in   manifest editor, note that changes made to it will be written by PDE to the <em>build.properties</em> file of the plug-in.&nbsp; This file solely guides the build   process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Runtime Information</p>
<p>The <strong>Runtime Information</strong> section lists all the libraries that you want to   build.&nbsp; For each library, you must list the source folder(s) that will be   compiled into the library. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/runtime.png" alt="Runtime" hspace="30"></p>
<p>If your plug-in declares more than one library, order them   correctly using the Up and Down button, so that they get compiled in the correct   order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Binary and Source Builds </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/binary_source.png" alt="Binary and Source Builds" width="648" height="217"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The <strong>Binary Build</strong> section is where you select all the files   and folders that will make it into the packaged plug-in.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The <strong>Source Build </strong>section has a specialized purpose and is   not commonly used or needed by the general population.&nbsp; It is needed only when   you are shipping source in separate plug-ins and features than the binary   plug-ins.&nbsp; See the <A href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_pde_core_source.html">org.eclipse.pde.core.source</A> extension point for details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Extra Classpath Entries </p>
<p align="left">If you need extra libraries on the build path for   your source code to compile, you can add these required JARs in the <strong>Extra Classpath   Entries</strong> section. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/classpath.png" alt="Extra Classpath"></p>
<p>Note that this section should be used to add libraries that are not required to be on the plug-in runtime classpath. </p>
