<p class="style1">Overview</p>
<p>The <strong>Overview</strong> page serves a dual purpose:</p>
<ol>
  <li> It contains two main sections, <strong>General Information</strong> and <strong>Execution Environments</strong>, that define important properties of the plug-in. </li>
  <li>It functions as a quick reference on how to develop, test and deploy plug-ins. It does so by providing the <strong>Plug-in Content</strong>, <strong>Extensions</strong>, <strong>Testing</strong> and <strong>Exporting</strong> sections, which serve as navigational points where you can follow hyperlinks to navigate to pages or invoke commands. </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">General Information</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/overview_general.png" alt="General Overview" hspace="30"> </p>
<p>An<strong> ID</strong> is mandatory and must comply with the <a href="../../../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/plugin_manifest.html">plugin.dtd</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong>version</strong> is mandatory and must be of the form <em>major.minor.micro.qualifier</em> (e.g. 1.3.0).</p>
<p>A<strong> name</strong> is the translatable presentation name of the plug-in. This field is required. </p>
<p>A<strong> provider</strong> is the translatable name of the plug-in provider. This field is optional. </p>
<p>A <strong>platform filter</strong> is a valid LDAP string that must evaluate to true in a running system for the the plug-in to run. For example, if a plug-in has the following   filter in its <EM>MANIFEST.MF</EM>: </p>
<p><STRONG>Eclipse-PlatformFilter: (ws=win32)</STRONG>, the filter indicates that the plug-in is   designed to run only on platforms with a <EM>win32</EM> windowing system. If a   user attempts to run Eclipse on a platform that does not meet this requirement,   the plug-in will be silently ignored by the runtime. </p>
<p>An <strong>activator</strong> is a Java class that controls the plug-in's life cycle. It is only needed if you require to do work upon the startup or shutdown of your plug-in. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Execution Environments </p>
<p>A bundle execution environment specifies the minimum level of JRE required for   the plug-in to run. If the JRE used to run Eclipse does not meet the   requirement, the plug-in will not run. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/overview_execution.png" alt="Execution Environments" hspace="30"></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Add...</strong> button to see the list of available of available execution environments and add the one that is most suitable for your plug-in. </p>
<p>If you declare <em>J2SE-1.4</em> as your plug-in's bundle execution environment, for   example, your plug-in will run with a JRE version &gt;= 1.4.</p>
<p>If the plug-in can run in execution environments that are not proper subsets   of each other (e.g <em>J2SE-1.4</em> and <em>CDC-1.1/Foundation-1.1</em>), then all such bundle   execution environments should be listed.</p>
<p>During a plug-in export, the plug-in code is compiled against the JRE   associated with the first execution environment listed in the <em>MANIFEST.MF</em> file  .&nbsp; Click on the <strong>Configure JRE associations...</strong> link to open the <strong>Windows &gt; Preferences... &gt; Java &gt; Installed JREs &gt; Execution Environments</strong> preference   page for a list of OSGi execution environments and the list of installed JREs   that are compatible with each.</p>
<p>Whenever you update the list of execution environments for your plug-in, you should update the classpath and the compiler compliance settings via the link to ensure you are compiling against the right JRE and you have the settings that best match your first execution environment. </p>
