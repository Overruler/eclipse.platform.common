<h2>Runtime page</h2>
<p>The Runtime page shows information about run-time libraries. When packaged,
platform plug-ins deliver all of their Java classes in JAR libraries. This page defines how
the classes that are in source folders during the design time are packaged into
the libraries. One source folder and one library have already been set during
the project creation by the wizard. You can define more on this page.</p>

<i><blockquote>Note:&nbsp; The information about the source folders that should be
compiled to produce the libraries is actually stored in a separate file (<b>build.properties</b>).
When you change this information, <b> build.properties</b> will be updated. This can
only happen if the file is not in use. If it is, the manifest editor will indicate
that the file is in use and you will only be able to browse the information.</blockquote></i>
<p>By default, a library is of type 'code', and thus assumed to contain 
executable code and resources.&nbsp; Accessing anything from such a library 
causes the activation of the plug-in and all its dependencies.&nbsp; If a 
library in your plug-in is not to contain executable code, e.g. libraries that 
hold translated NL strings only, it should be marked of type 'resource'.&nbsp; 
Accessing a 'resource' from such a library does not activate the plug-in, thus 
greatly improving performance.</p>
<p>You can also determine exporting rules for your libraries. By default, no
classes in your libraries can be seen by others. This is appropriate if your
plug-in is not meant to be extended. If your classes should be visible to other
plug-ins, the libraries
must be exported. You can export the entire library, or just some portions that
match the provided content filters (for example, <b>com.example.*</b>).</p>
<p>Declaring package prefixes for a library results in 10-15% increase in class 
loading speed.</p>
