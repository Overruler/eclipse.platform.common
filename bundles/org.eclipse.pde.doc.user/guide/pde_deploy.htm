<h1>Deploying a plug-in</h1>
<p>During the design phase, plug-ins and fragments in your workspace are used
as-is so that you can quickly test and debug. Once you reach the stage where you
are satisfied with your code, you need to publish it in a form fit for delivery on
the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to do so is through the 'Export Plug-ins and Fragments' 
Wizard.&nbsp; It shields you from ant scripts and does not pollute your 
workspace with resources generated during the build operations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <b>File&gt;Export...&gt;Deployable plug-ins and fragments</b></li>
  <li>Select the plug-ins and fragments you want to export.&nbsp; The 'single 
  deployable ZIP file' option will create one zip file containing all the 
  selected plug-ins and fragments, which can be directly unzipped into any 
  Eclipse product.&nbsp; The 'individual JAR archives' option will create a jar 
  file for every selected plug-in and fragment.&nbsp; The jar files are named 
  according to the format: <b>&lt;plug-in id&gt;_&lt;plug-in version&gt;.jar</b></li>
</ol>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
An alternate way is to build a plug-in or a fragment manually:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the plugin.xml file for your plug-in (or the fragment.xml file for 
  your fragment) and choose 'Create Ant Build File'.&nbsp; This will create a 
  build.xml file.</li>
  <li>Select the build.xml file and choose 'Runt Ant...'.&nbsp; This will open 
  the Ant build script wizard.</li>
  <li>Choose the target(s) of your choice and then press 'Run'.</li>
</ol>

<p align="center">
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You can also package your plug-in(s) and fragment(s) into a <b>feature</b>.&nbsp; 
This lets you use the platform Install and Update Manager to deliver your 
feature.&nbsp; You can make it available on a server and publish the URL. The 
platform Update Manager can be used to download and install your feature.</p>
<p>The remaining sections describe features and how to build them.</p>
