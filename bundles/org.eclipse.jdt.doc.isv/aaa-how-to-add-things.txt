To add new plug-ins you need to make changes in several places in
this doc plug-in:

jdtOptions.txt
- the plug-in's source folder(s) must be included on the -sourcepath
- the package names must be included in the (alphabetical) package list at the end of the file

jdtOptions (the Unix version of jdtOptions.txt)
- same changes as jdtOptions.txt but with ":" path separators

buildDoc.xml
- add a line in convertSchemaToHtml target to handle a new plug-ins extension point schemas

reference/extension-points/index.html
