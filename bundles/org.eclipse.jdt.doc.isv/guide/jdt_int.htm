<h1> Java Development Tooling overview</h1>
<p>The Eclipse platform is delivered with a full featured Java integrated development 
  environment (IDE). Java development tooling (JDT) allows users to write, compile, 
  test, debug, and edit programs written in the Java programming language.</p>
<p>The JDT makes use of many of the platform extension points and frameworks described 
  in the Platform Plug-in Developer Guide.</p>
<p> This guide discusses the extension points and API provided by the JDT. 
  We assume that you already understand the concepts of plug-ins, extension points, 
  workspace resources, and the workbench UI.</p>
<p>We first look at how the JDT tools are structured. It's easiest to think of 
  the JDT as a set of plug-ins that add Java specific behavior to the generic 
  platform resource model and contribute Java specific views, editors, and actions 
  to the workbench.</p>
<p>Then we will look at how to use the JDT API to accomplish common tasks, such 
  as generating, compiling, and running Java code programmatically.</p>
