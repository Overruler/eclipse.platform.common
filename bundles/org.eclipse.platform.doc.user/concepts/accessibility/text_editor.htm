<h1>Configuring accessibility options for textual editors</h1>
Besides the options to change colors and fonts as shown by the related tasks listed below, textual editors in Eclipse can be configured to better fit the needs of people with a physical disability. This document describes the relevant options.

<h2>Accessing Annotations</h2>
<p>You can navigate to the next annotation by pressing <b>Ctrl+.</b> and to the previous ony by pressing <b>Ctrl+,</b>. Out of the box not all available annotation types are included in that navigation,
e.g. breakpoints are not part of it. Breakpoints and other annotation types can either be enabled via the <b>Next Annotation</b> toolbar button drop-down menu or by checking <b>Include in next/previous navigation</b> on the
<a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.editors.preferencePages.Annotations)")'>
   <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
   <strong>General &gt; Editors &gt; Text Editors &gt; Annotations</strong></a> preference page.</p>
<p>Navigating to an annotation lets its text appear in the status line. The next section explains how to read the status line under Windows.</p>
<p>Some annotation types like e.g. warnings and errors, can
be accessed by pressing <b>F2</b> after having navigated to one of them or setting the caret inside the annotation.</p> 

<h2>Accessing Current Line Number</h2>
<p>You can get the current line number by pressing <b>Ctrl+L</b> or via <b>Navigate &gt; Go To Line...</b>.</p>
 
<h2><img src="../../images/win_only.png" alt="Windows only" border="0" >Reading the status line with JAWS</h2>
JAWS desktop users press <b>Insert+PageDown</b> to read the Eclipse status line and JAWS laptop users press <b>Caps Lock+PageDown</b>.


<h2>Quick Diff Hover</h2>
Like normal hovers can be shown by pressing <b>F2</b>, the quick diff diff and revision hovers that appear when hovering over the quick diff ruler on the left can also be shown by pressing a key sequence.
However, out of the box no key sequence is defined for that. Go to the <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Keys)")'>
   <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
   <strong>General &gt; Keys</strong></a> preference page to assign a key sequence to the <b>Show Quick Diff Ruler Tooltip</b> command.

<h2>Annotation Hover</h2>
Like normal hovers can be shown by pressing <b>F2</b>, the annotation hover that appears when hovering over the vertical ruler on the left can also be shown by pressing a key sequence.
However, out of the box no key sequence is defined for that. Go to the <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Keys)")'>
   <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
   <strong>General &gt; Keys</strong></a> preference page to assign a key sequence to the <b>Show Ruler Annotation Tooltip</b> command.

<h2>Reading Words in the Java Editor</h2>
<p>In order to get correct results when letting the screen reader read words in the Java editor it is recommended to
disable <b>Smart caret positioning in Java names</b> on the <b>Java &gt; Editor</b> preference page.</p>
