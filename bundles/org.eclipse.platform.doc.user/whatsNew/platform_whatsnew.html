<h2>What's New in 3.0</h2>
<p>Here are some of the more interesting or significant changes made to the
Eclipse Platform for the 3.0 release of Eclipse since 2.1:</p>

      <p>Blurb.</p>
      <p>If a small image sheds light, place it below the description, in a
      separate paragraph. Screen snapshots should be done at 1152x864 resolution
      on Windows XP with default theme, default fonts, and default font size.
      Crop out any extraneous stuff to focus the reader's attention on your new
      feature. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The image should be no
      more than 466 pixels wide and in GIF format</span> (not TIF, not BMP, not
      JPG) with an exact palette (not web) so as to properly capture the
      gradient shading in the borders. Name the file is a way that is
      appropriate and specific to the item (e.g., key-bindings.gif, rather than
      something generic like image.gif).</td>

      The colors show additions, deletions, and changes to the editor buffer as

      <p><img alt="Revert changes using the margin's popup menu" src="images/quickdiff-menu.gif" width="402" height="157"></p>
      Due to the high memory consumption of the diff algorithm, Quick Diff
      suspends itself when there are overly many changes between the current and
      the reference file. This avoids putting the system under memory pressure
      and is indicated by a single change spanning the whole file with an empty
      original text in the hover on the change ruler column.&nbsp;
      <p>Quick Diff is reset to normal operation by disabling and re-enabling it
      (for example by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Q twice).
