          from closed, deleted, or unavailable projects. As well, you can filter 
          specific kinds of configurations. The dialog and history menus optionally 
          support the current workbench window working sets.</p>

        <p>For resource based filtering to work, you need to migrate your existing 
          launch configurations. This can be done by pressing the <strong>Migrate</strong> 
          button on the preference page.</p>
        <p>The filters are also available for easy access in a new toolbar in 
          the launch dialog.</p>

      <td><p>Variables can be displayed using columns or a standard tree. To toggle 
          columns on/off use the view menu's <strong>Layout &gt; Show Columns</strong> 
          action. You can select the columns to be displayed using the <strong>Layout 
          &gt; Select Columns</strong> action. Recently changed variables are 
          displayed with a yellow background (controlled by the &quot;Changed 
          value background color&quot; user preference via the <strong>Run/Debug</strong> 
          preference page). The Java debugger supports editing of Strings and 
          primitive values inline.</p>
