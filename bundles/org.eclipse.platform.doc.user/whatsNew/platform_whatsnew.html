      Eclipse 3.0 now opens with a new Welcome. It contains several pages 
      allowing you to learn about Eclipse, follow tutorials, try out samples or 
      learn what's new in this release. The new feature is fully pluggable and 
      Eclipse-based products can define their own Welcome using the same

      <p><img src="images/responsiveui2.gif" width="450" height="328"></p>
      <p>This dialog also shows you the details of other currently running

        <li>ability to dynamically add UI components (based on OSGI runtime)</li>

        <li>support for single and multiple editor tabs
            <ul>

        <li>affordance for editor pinning. When limiting the number of editors that can be opened at once, some editors that should not be closed can be pinned, there is now an affordance to indicate when an editor is pinned</li>

      Project</b> commands have been replaced with a single <b>Clean...</b>

      command. The <b>Build Project</b> command in the <b>Project</b> menu (and
      in context menus) has been made smarter. It will now also build
      out-of-date prerequisite projects of the selected project if necessary. A
      new <b>Build Working Set</b> sub-menu lets you choose a set of projects to
      be built; this command brings all projects in that working set up to date,
      building any prerequisite projects that are not in the working set if (and
      only if) required. And you can quickly toggle auto-build on and off with <b>Build
      Automatically</b>.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The Eclipse runtime has been modified to run on top of an implementation
        of the OSGi framework specification (see <a href="http://osgi.org">osgi.org</a>).
        This move increases the runtime's flexibility and paves the way for the
        use of Eclipse in a wider range of scenarios and environments. By choosing
        a standard base for the runtime, Eclipse developers are able to reuse
        existing function and infrastructure. Regular Eclipse users benefit from
        these changes as the runtime is now dynamic. New plug-ins can be installed
        into a running Eclipse and used without restarting.</p>

	<p>In order to handle right-to-left and complex scripts it is necessary to deal with several problems.
	For example, languages like Hebrew and Arabic are written from right to left, which requires the
	text to be reordered according to the Bidi Algorithm described in Unicode annex #9, before drawing and measuring.
	Other languages, like Arabic and Farsi, require contextual shaping, which means that the same character can assume
	different forms according to its position in the word. Other common problems are combined characters or ligatures
	(two characters that are joined together). Languages like Thai have special rules for word breaking and cursor navigation.
	Windows supports all cases previously mentioned. On GTK support for Bidi is implemented,
    but complex scripts
	(Thai, South Asian scripts) are still not fully supported.</p>

      <p><b>Quick Diff: colored change indication in editor
      vertical ruler</b></p>
    </td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">
      <p>A new color-coded change indicator in the editor's vertical ruler can
      be turned on for text editors using either the ruler context menu or <code>CTRL+SHIFT+Q</code>.
      The colors show additions, deletions, and changes to the editor buffer as
      compared to a reference, for example, the contents of the file on disk or
      its latest CVS revision.</p>
      <p><img alt="Quick Diff" src="images/quickdiff.gif" width="466" height="108"></p>
      <p>When the mouse cursor is placed over a change in the vertical ruler, a
      hover displays the original content:</p>
      <p><img alt="Hover over the margin to see changes" src="images/quickdiff-hover.gif" width="466" height="108"></p>
      <p>The original content can be restored using the ruler's context menu.
      The context menu also allows to switch between references and
      enable/disable Quick Diff:</p>
      <p><img alt="Revert changes using the margin's popup menu" src="images/quickdiff-menu.gif" width="402" height="157"></p>
      Due to the high memory consumption of the diff algorithm, Quick Diff
      suspends itself when there are overly many changes between the current and
      the reference file. This avoids putting the system under memory pressure
      and is indicated by a single change spanning the whole file with an empty
      original text in the hover on the change ruler column.&nbsp;
      <p>Quick Diff is reset to normal operation by disabling and re-enabling it
      (for example by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Q twice).
