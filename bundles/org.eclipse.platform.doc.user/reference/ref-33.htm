<h1>Synchronize view</h1>
<p class="Para"> This view allows you to update resources in the Workbench 
and commit resources from the Workbench to a repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   
<p class="Para"> Here is what the Synchronize view looks like:</p>
   
<p class="Para"> <img align="top" border="0"
 src="../images/Image245_sync_view.gif" alt="Synchonization View">
 </p>
   
<div class="XRefList">     
<h2 class="Para">Modes</h2>
     
<p> There are three different viewing modes (filters) that you can use in 
this      view to make the synchronization process easier:</p>
     
<dl>
  <dt>Incoming</dt>
  <dd>In this mode, only resources which have been changed in the repository 
       since they were last loaded or synchronized with those in the Workbench 
       (incoming changes) are visible. If you have incoming changes when you
synchronize,        you will start off in this mode.</dd>
  <dt>Outgoing</dt>
  <dd> In this mode, only resources which have been modified in the Workbench 
       (outgoing changes) are visible.&nbsp;If you do not have incoming changes 
       when you synchronize, you will start in this mode.</dd>
  <dt>Incoming/Outgoing</dt>
    <dd> In this mode both incoming and outgoing changes are shown, and you can 
      both update and commit. You will remain in this mode with future synchronizations 
      until you close the view.&nbsp; The advantage to using this dual mode is 
      you can do either task as you choose. The disadvantage is that performing 
      a simultaneous bi-directional merge is often complicated. In addition, you 
      risk accidentally committing a conflict when you meant to update to it. 
      You can choose to always use Incoming/Outgoing mode on the Workbench preferences 
      page (<b>Window&gt; Preferences &gt; Team</b>).</dd>
</dl>
     
<p class="Para">Modes not only filter the set of visible changes but also 
restrict the set of operations available. 
You can switch modes using the toolbar of the Synchronization 
view.</p>

<P>The advantages to modes are: </P>
<ul>
  <li>
    They support and encourage the <a href="../concepts/concepts-26.htm#IdealWorkFlow"> ideal work flow.</a></li>
  <li>
    They reduce the amount of information you are faced with at any one time.</li>
    <li> They provide a degree of safety restricting you to those operations appropriate 
      to that mode. For example, you can''t accidentally commit a conflict when 
      in incoming mode.</li>
</ul>

<p class="Para">Regardless of the mode that you select, you will always see 
     any conflicts that exist. You can filter out other outgoing and incoming 
changes      by clicking the <b> Show Only Conflicts</b> button.&nbsp; You 
can also choose      to Compare File Contents (and show only those resources 
whose contents differ),      Ignore Whitespace differences or Refresh From 
Repository from the drop-down      menu of this view.</p>
     
  <p class="Para"> <b>Important</b>: It is preferable to update resources in the 
    Workbench first, resolve any conflicts that exist by merging, then commit 
    Workbench resources to the repository.</p>
  <h2 class="Para">Synchronization state</h2>
  <p class="Para">The top left pane in the synchronize view shows the synchronization 
    state of resources in your workspace compared to those in the repository. 
    This state is shown by using icons and can also be configured to show the 
    state as text appended to the resource name. A description of the icons is 
    shown in the table below:</p>
  <table width="100%" border="1">

      <td width="91%">An incoming addition means that a resource has been added 
        to the repository. <strong>Updating</strong> will transfer the resource

      <td>An incoming change means that the file has changed in the repository. 
        <strong>Updating</strong> will transfer the new file revision to your 
        workspace.</td>

      <td align="center"><img src="../images/r_indel_ov.gif" alt="Incoming deletion icon" width="11" height="10"></td>

        the repository. Instead, files are deleted and empty directories are pruned 
        from your workspace. </td>

        by CVS. This is because the file was changed locally and remotely but 
        in different locations in the file. This indicator is important because 
        it can allow you to review the changes from within the synchronization 
        view and then perform a <strong>Override and Update</strong> that will 
        perform the merge automatically for you.</td>
