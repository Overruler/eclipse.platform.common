On some releases of AIX, you may need to install gnu tar (http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/tar.html)
to extract the eclipse tar.gz file.  This is because of incompatibilities
between tar versions.  See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=82568
for further details.

You can run Eclipse using the VM from IBM Developer Kit for AIX versions 
1.3.0, 1.3.1, and 1.4.0.  The IBM Developer Kit for AIX can be downloaded from:
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/aix/service.html
