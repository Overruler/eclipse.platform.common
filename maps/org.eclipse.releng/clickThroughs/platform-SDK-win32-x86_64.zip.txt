his build requires a 64-bit JVM, and will not run with a 32-bit JVM.
You can, for example, use the Sun 64-bit 1.5 JVM for AMD64.  Note
that the Sun 1.4.2 JVM for AMD64 is 32-bit and therefore cannot be
used to run this build.

There is a bug in the Oracle Java 7 64-bit JRE (b147) which may cause Eclipse
to crash (http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7070134).  
The crash can be avoided by using the -XX:-UseLoopPredicate VM argument 
(-vmargs -XX:-UseLoopPredicate).  Alternatively, you can use a different JRE.
