The RCP downloads are meant as a base for building Eclipse RCP applications.  
As such, they do not include an application of their own and simply running the 
RCP install will do nothing.

To launch eclipse you must disable file locking using the osgi.locking property. For example, you could launch eclipse as follows:

"eclipse -vmargs -Dosgi.locking=none".


Otherwise, eclipse fails to create a lock file with reason: "Workspace in use or cannot be created, choose a different one."
