Important note about running Eclipse on GTK

In preparation for the release of the new GTK2 version of Eclipse the platform name for the GTK1.2 version of Eclipse has been changed to "gtk1x".

In order to run the M4 or subsequent builds of Eclipse on GTK, you should no longer use the "-ws gtk" argument to launch Eclipse.  The launcher has been modified to correctly determine the appropriate windowing system.

Note for power users: 

If you have a custom install where you have both the Motif and GTK versions of SWT available, you will still get the Motif version by default. In this case you can force GTK to be loaded by adding "-ws gtk1x".

Older Information

Requirements: 
The current release of SWT for GTK+ was developed and tested on GTK+ 1.2.10 
and gdk-pixbuf 0.11 running on Linux/i386. 

If you try building SWT for GTK+ 1.2 on any other (i.e., non-Linux and/or 
non-Intel) platform, you may want to share your experience on the SWT 
development mailing list (platform-swt-dev@eclipse.org). 

Currently, SWT for GTK+ does not build / run with GTK+ 1.3 (GTK+ 2.0). 

Currently, there is no GTK-specific launcher. You can use the Motif one -
which works fine, just specify GTK as the UI system (./eclipse -ws gtk),
or use a java command line.

If you want to rebuild SWT for GTK+: 

1. Get the latest stable Eclipse drop [for Motif]. 
2. Turn auto-build off (Window -> Preferences -> Workbench). 
(If you don't, you will be negatively surprised when you check 
out from CVS). 
3. In the Repository View, connect to 
:pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/eclipse 
Checking out from CVS is realy the only way to get SWT source; the stuff 
in swtsrc.zip is for debugging other plugins when running SWT as an 
external plugin. 
4. Add project org.eclipse.swt from the HEAD stream. 
5. Set the right CLASSPATH. One way to do this, in the Navigator View, 
copy ".classpath_gtk" to ".classpath" (first right-click -> Copy, 
and then Rename). 
6. Build the Java world. 
7. In addition to the .class files, the Java build process produced the 
merged library directory. To compile the C code for the JNI bindings, 
go to the bin/library directory (NOT gtk/library), and run build.csh. 
8. Copy the *.so files into where the JVM can normally find them, to run 
the examles, _AND_ to the plugin directory - if you want to run Eclipse. 


Known Limitations:

are incomplete or unimplemented. These include:
